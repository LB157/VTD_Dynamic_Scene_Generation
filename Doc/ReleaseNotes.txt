Release Notes for VIRES Virtual Test Drive
==========================================

VTD 2.2.0, 31.12.2018
---------------------

+ --------- SUMMARY section

Operating System:
    - support for Ubuntu 18.04 and OpenSuSE Leap 42.x
    - using OptiX 5.0.1 (requires NVIDIA driver 384.98 or higher)
    - using CUDA 9.0.176.4
   
    - IMPORTANT NOTE: In Ubuntu 18.04 the default DISPLAY value is 1 not 0. Therefore we added scripts to our setups 
                      for automatic change of the display value. If you are avoiding overwriting by the scripts in your 

    - NOTE: this is the last version that can still run on RedHat 6.x.

Distribution:
    - base package includes a wide range of vehicles
    - new, more extensive demo database included
    - static dummy pedestrian has been replaced with an animated pedestrian, so that even without a pedestrian license,
      pedestrian scenarios will show animated limbs (only one pedestrian model will be available without further licensing)

Licensing:
    - MAC address of inactive devices can be retrieved so that explicit assignment of "VI_LIC_DEVICE" is no longer needed
    - License server allows 500 concurrent licenses

TaskControl:
    - resolved INIT problems (TC waits properly for connection with traffic; pressing PLAY or INIT first in GUI makes no difference)
    - time zone and date may be set via SCP (and will be published in RDB_ENVIRONMENT message)
      Example:
          <Environment><TimeOfDay timezone="mm"/></Environment> (with mm being the minutes deviation to GMT (westbound is positive))

          <Environment><Date day="DD" month="MM" year="YYYY" /></Environment>

    - IG component is no longer automatically added if IG is enabled; TC waits for active IG state information, ticket #8834
    - fixing pedestrian acceleration and speed calculation, ticket #8277 and #4687
    - fixed traffic light creation, ticket #7991
    - master player is not switched if new external player is created and another master still exists

    - internal state transitions of the TC are now reported via SCP, 
      Example: '<Info level="debug"><SimState state="POST-INIT"/></Info>'
    - DriverInput-override is now also taken into account for the gear, i.e. setting gear via SCP 
      and having override="true" has the highest priority
    - fixed calculation of focal and principal points in camera class, ticket #6729
    - publishing now ALL defined cameras via RDB with the current camera being the first one on the bus, ticket #6687
    - fixed handling of multiple external objects whose co-ordinates are received in "RELATIVE_START" system
    - UDP send on RDB can be disabled completely, jira ticket
    - SimSate may be queried explicitly, ticket #7627, example: <Query entity="taskControl"><SimState/></Query>
    - object size of an object controlled by an external instance may be derived from received OBJECT_STATE 
      messages if the configuration flag RDB_OBJECT_CFG_FLAG_AUTO_SCALE is set, ticket #7634
      Example:
        sOwnObjectState.base.geo.dimX = 4.60;
        sOwnObjectState.base.geo.dimY = 1.86;
        sOwnObjectState.base.geo.dimZ = 1.60;

    - Default IG communication protocol is precision11, ticket #8123

ModuleManager:
    - Sensor plug-ins may be given an explicit numeric id (new attribute "id" in the <Load>-tag), so that multiple instances
      of the ModuleManager don't create confusing feedback to the TC; usually, each MM instance starts counting the sensors
      from 0.
    - Sensor UDP output may be set to unicast by providing the additional attribute "targetAddress" 

    - CameraSensor: 
      - taking orientation offsets of signs into account for bounding box calculation, ticket #7491
      - a specific camera can be addressed instead of using only the first in the list; for this, provide the extra attribute "cameraId" 
      within the <Config> tag

    - PerfectSensorExt:
      - added option "useEdgeCenters" to report hits on edge centers only (front/rear/left/right), ticket #6389
      - corrected calculation of heading angle in sensor co-ordinates, ticket #7892
      - corrected reference point for check of closest point, ticket #8561

      - traffic signs may be detected independent of orientation by specifying filter "trafficSignAllDir" 
      - more tolerant definition of surround sensor (vFoV)
      - relative lane position of all detected objects which are on a lane will be reported in SENSOR_OBJECT_t.deltaLanePos
      - added further roadmark types
      - pitch and roll angles of tilted traffic signs are reported correctly, ticket #7677
      - for better control of network traffic, the sensors now allow the filtering of individual packages at the output of the sensor. 
        If no output filter is provided then the behavior is as in previous versions, if the line
             <Filter rdbPkgId="anyId"/>
        is provided, only a certain package will be sent via the sensor output. The user may add multiple entries.

    - Default IG communication protocol is precision11, ticket #8123

ModuleManager:
    - Sensor plug-ins may be given an explicit numeric id (new attribute "id" in the <Load>-tag), so that multiple instances
      of the ModuleManager don't create confusing feedback to the TC; usually, each MM instance starts counting the sensors
      from 0.
    - Sensor UDP output may be set to unicast by providing the additional attribute "targetAddress" 
      Example:

        <Sensor name="DefaultPerfectSensor" type="video">
            :
            <Port name="RDBout" number="48185" type="UDP" sendEgo="true" targetAddress="10.173.18.10"/>

      - more tolerant definition of surround sensor (vFoV)
      - relative lane position of all detected objects which are on a lane will be reported in SENSOR_OBJECT_t.deltaLanePos
      - added further roadmark types
      - pitch and roll angles of tilted traffic signs are reported correctly, ticket #7677
      - for better control of network traffic, the sensors now allow the filtering of individual packages at the output of the sensor. If no output filter is provided
        then the behavior is as in previous versions, if the line
             <Filter rdbPkgId="anyId"/>
         is provided, only a certain package will be sent via the sensor output. The user may add multiple entries. 
         For example, if the following sensor is specified

           <Sensor name="DefaultPerfectSensor" type="video">
             <Load     lib="libModulePerfectSensor.so" path="" persistent="true" />

             <Filter   rdbPkgId="5"/>
             <Debug    enable="false"/>
           </Sensor>

         the RDBsniffer reports the following traffic

           RDBHandler::printMessage: ---- short info ----- BEGIN

           RDBHandler::printMessage: ---- short info ----- END

ScpGenerator:

    Physically Based Rendering (PBR) - v.1.0
    - PBR is the most advanced rendering technique for accurate calculations of dynamic light/surface interactions. Usually used for offline 
      rendering and raytracing engines due to its bigger performance impact in comparison to previous methods, PBR is the key to realistic surface 
      representations. The core of PBR consists of measured material properties like roughness, Fresnel reflectance, diffuse color, 
      metallic property and surface normal map in combination with an advanced BRDF function (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). 
    - Scanned textures were aquired from a third party - Quixel AB 2018
      Uses Megascans (TM), Copyright (c) ? 2018 Quixel AB
    - as this is the first release it contains some bugs and artefacts that will be removed in future releases. A list of known issues will be 
      provided at the end of this section.
    - it is recommended to use a GPU with 4GB Video RAM or greater (GTX 1060 as a minimum). GPUs with less RAM will suffer from low frame-rates due to the memory bottleneck. 
    - cars/vehicle bodies are rendered with the old approach due to the complexity and time needed when generating PBR models. Future releases will 
      include vehicle materials.
    - the focus of this release is set on the correctness in the core shader, BRDF calculations and surface reflectivity values all based on 
      measured materials without the need for adjustments in material properties to filter edge cases. Also, it sets a future ground for further 
      improvements and extensions.

    - Following setups are available with this release:
          - PBR_LDR: low dynamic range PBR rendering. The output buffer is set to 8bit per channel (RGBA). All input lights (sun and sky included) 
                 are scaled to fit into this smaller range creating unavoidable artefacts in the lower/upper range. Some scaling/adjustment in 
                 intensity of these light sources are also present to counter the mentioned artefacts. This is the fastest rendering at a cost 
                 of a bigger difference to reality. This setup uses the HCS sky.
          - PBR_StandartSettings: High dynamic range rendering with 8bit bit per channel (RGBA) and static tone mapping to 
                     scale pixel values down to the visible range. No adjustments in light intensities are needed in this setup as the lower and 
                     upper range can be visualized correctly with a configurable tone mapping curve. CubeMap Reflections are clamped to 250m and 256x256px
                     per cube site. This setup uses the new PBR sky.
          - PBR_HighSettings: Same as PBR_StandartSettings except of: FXAA 4x + MSAA 4x antialiasing is used to prevent flickering and create a smooth image.
          - PBR_UltraSettings: Same as PBR_HighSettings except of: CubeMap Reflections are clamped to 500m and 1024x1024px per cube site for higher resolution reflections.

    - known bugs/artefacts/ missing features:
          - all vehicles bodies are rendered with the old rendering approach due to time complexity needed when generating these models in PBR
          - for performance reasons, the reflections rays are shot against a simplified scene that is not rendered with all effects. 
            Due to this limitation, the color sampled from the reflection scene is not correct in some areas and creates artefacts.
          - CubeMapReflection with the centre being the camera position are used for specular reflection calculations. Therefore, all known 
            artefacts coming with cube-map approaches are therefore present (sinking objects etz..)
          - performance is not perfectly optimized and might vary depending on the scene the camera is looking at, future releases will 
            concentrate on performance optimisations.
          - shadows are optimized for the ego car camera position, moving the camera around might show artefacts in shadows. Also, objects
            that are far away will not have any shadows due to the limit in the shadow texture resolution and size.
          - at small distances between perpendicular connecting walls (example: a building inner corner - not outer corner) shadows might not be 
            calculated correctly and a lit surface might be calculated instead. This is most visible when the sun is at dawn or at sunset 
            and is relatively near the ground. At this time, specular reflections are very strong and highlight these areas since the contrast 
            between a shadow and a specular reflecting surface is the strongest.
          - PBR_{XY}Settings setups: these setups use a tone mapping curve defined in the new PBRSky.xml. This curve has to be calibrated for a certain
            scenario to produce the best possible results. PBRSky.xml has predefined values that might be inaccurate in some cases. 
            Example: tonemappingParams0="0.22 0.30 0.10 0.20" tonemappingParams1="0.01 0.3 11.2 0.00433876" 

    Detailed:
    - vigcar
    - Add TAKATA/renderLatestFrame xml option to skip ahead if the IG is lagging behind with rendering. 
            Disabled by default
    - Add TaskState message, IG instances now generate the SCP heartbeat message when active.
    - Add -n commandline argument to allow explicit override of the default IG_<pid>@<hostname> task name.
    - Fix delay and upper limit for handled traffic lights per frame. 

    - libVIGFramework

        to the listed file names.

    - VIG PostProcessing
    - multi camera postprocessing was added
    - textureType was added as a parameter for RTT (Texture2D & TextureRectangle):
        <RTT sizeMode="viewport" textureType="Texture2D"        bufferFormat="GL_RGB8" />
        <RTT sizeMode="viewport" textureType="TextureRectangle" bufferFormat="GL_RGB8" />

    - DI Guy
    - Improve frame update by avoiding euler angles. 

    - AnimatedPedestrians
    - Improve frame update using optimized keyframe storage and interpolation.

    - OptiX and CUDA
    - OptiX was updated to 5.0.1
    - CUDA was updated to 9.0.176.4

    - OptiXPluginLib
    - Settings were moved to vigOptiX::Settings - following steps to follow when moving plugin from 2.1.0 to 2.1.1:
        - the old settings in /Plugin/include/settings have to be removed
        - also from the cmake files (Plugin/src/base/CMakeLists.txt (example Plugins/OptiXPluginLib/src/vigOptiX/CMakeLists.txt)
        - Settings.h and Settings member variables have to be removed from all header files 
        - to get vigOptiX::Settings call getSettings() anywhere in the plugin (except main.cpp)
        - following functions/variables have to be adjusted in header and cpp files:

            OptiX{PluginName}.h
            virtual void createOptiXDrawable(vig::ImageGenerator* ig, vigOptiX::Settings& settings);

            OptiX{PluginName}.cpp
            void OptiX{PluginName}::createOptiXDrawable(vig::ImageGenerator* ig, vigOptiX::Settings& settings)
            {
                m_optiXDrawable = new OptiXLidarDrawable(ig, &settings);
            }

            OptiX{PluginName}Drawable.h
            OptiX{PluginName}Drawable(vig::ImageGenerator* ig = 0, const vigOptiX::Settings* settings = 0);
            virtual void createOptiXInterface(osg::RenderInfo&, const vigOptiX::Settings& settings, unsigned int width, unsigned int height) const;

            OptiX{PluginName}Drawable.cpp
            OptiX{PluginName}Drawable::OptiX{PluginName}Drawable(vig::ImageGenerator* ig, const vigOptiX::Settings* settings)
                : vigOptiX::OptiXDrawable(ig, settings)
                , renderTargetWidth(0u)
                , renderTargetHeight(0u)
            {
            ...
            }

            void OptiX{PluginName}Drawable::createOptiXInterface(osg::RenderInfo& renderInfo, const vigOptiX::Settings& settings, unsigned int width, unsigned int height) const
            {
                m_optiXInterface = new OptiXLidarInterface(renderInfo, settings, 0, renderTargetWidth, renderTargetHeight);
            }

            OptiX{PluginName}Interface.h
            OptiX{PluginName}Interface(const osg::RenderInfo& renderInfo, const vigOptiX::Settings& settings,
                        unsigned int numDevices,
                        unsigned int width, unsigned int height)
                : vigOptiX::OptiXInterface(renderInfo, settings, numDevices, width, height)
                { /**/ }
            Delete: virtual void updateLightBuffer(void);
            Delete: OptiXInterface::addVIGLightToOptiXLightBuffer( const BasicLight& )        
            Delete: OptiXInterface::m_vigLightsToConvert;

            OptiX{PluginName}Interface.cpp
            Delete: void OptiXRadarInterface::updateLightBuffer(void)

    - vigOptiX::Settings are now used for Debug configuration settings in ProjectIGConfig (XML)
    - OptiX usageReportLevel was added as an debug XML setting
    - new meta information was added to the updateObjectMetaData="1" XML setting. The new data are the following:

            // XYZ world position of object
            rtDeclareVariable(float3,               position,           ,                           );

            // HPR rotation of object
            rtDeclareVariable(float3,               hpr,                ,                           );

            // Dynamic object ID - matching with SE and RDB
            rtDeclareVariable(int,                  object_id,          ,                           );

    - distribution files for camera were added to set direction and staring intensity for each ray (pixel):
        - void addTextureToContext(const std::string& filePath, const std::string& contextVariableName);
        - void addTextureToContext(osg::ref_ptr<const osg::Image> image, const std::string& contextVariableName);
        - void addDistortionBufferToContext(const std::string& filePath, const std::string& contextVariableName);

    - OptiXBase.h was extended with PBR functions (BRDF) and camera distortion/distribution functions:

            __device__ float3 vigGetRayDirectionByDistributionBuffer(optix::buffer<float3, 2>& buffer, uint2 launch_index,
                                                                    const float3& U,
                                                                    const float3& V,
                                                                    const float3& W,
                                                                    uint2 offset = make_uint2(0, 0))

    - OptiXInterface::setVigLightsInOptixLightBuffer(const std::vector<BasicLight>& lights) replaces OptiXInterface::addVIGLightToOptiXLightBuffer(const BasicLight&). Active lights are not automatically collected in OptiXInterface::m_vigLightsToConvert anymore and instead applied the light buffer immediately when calling this function. Active lights can be read from the "lights" parameter, so in order to collect active lights this method needs to be overloaded in derived plugins.

    - OptiXCommand.h was changed so that class LightCommand handles a light array rather than single lights.

    - Sky
    - Added atmospheric perspective scattering to PBR, all vehicle shaders and new pedestrian shaders - enable in Graphics settings with enableAtmosphericPerspective="1" (default disabled = 0)
    - atmosphericPerspectiveFogColor describes the color used for the scattering effect
    - atmosphericPerspectiveFogSunColor describes the color used for the scattering effect when sun is shining against it
    - atmosphericPerspectiveFogDensity makes the effect stronger (>1) or weaker (<1) over distance
    - the effect is scaled based on SkyColor intensity - based on sky maximum (7000 for blue sky)
        we lineary interpolate based on current SkyColor intensity: 3500 (current) out of 7000 (max) = 50% scattering effect

VTD 2.1.0, 09.09.2017
---------------------

+ --------- SUMMARY section

Documentation:
    - user manuals are now under "Doc/Manuals" 
    - information about 3rd party software is in "Doc/Licensing" 

RDB:
    - version 0x011E

Distribution:
    - VTD will unpack in directory "VTD.2.1"
    - added 'configurationProfile="HIGH_CONTRAST"' to standard script "configureDisplay.sh" which switches the IG
      to the high-contrast databases. This entry may be removed it the new color / material scheme does not 
      fit one's purpose; in that case, the old material database will be re-used
    - removed the "DISPLAY" variable from all "simServer.xml" configuration files; the DISPLAY is to be set by the 
      user explicitly if required, otherwise the environment variable of the shell invoking VTD will be used, ticket #5798
    - the shadow database is no longer required

TaskControl:
    - traffic goes to "paused" when in pause mode instead of going to "fail", ticket #5681
    - TTC is shown at sensor symbols (provided it can be calculated, ticket #5005
    - added boolean configuration parameter "sendTrafficObjectCfgExtOnly" for RDB configuration
      so that the overall message size of RDB may be limited for HiL or SimWB systems

OdrGateway:
    - fixed TCP connection (wrong port was used for sending the results); bugreport via e-mail

SUMO Gateway:
    - the new SUMO version cannot handle spaces in vehicle names correctly. In VTD's conversion script,
      spaces are filled with '#' for SUMO and removed again when names are propagated to VTD

GhostDriver
    - support for net distance in ActionLateralDistance
    - bounding boxes for character models now support offset attributes
    - allow overtaking still standing cars
   -  many driver improvements in lane selection and routing decision making
    - basic OpenSCENARIO v0.9 and v0.9.1 support

Complex Dynamics
    - support for steering torque input
    - autobrake feature that allows zero movement after stopping the vehicle
    - improved player reset after loosing road contact in offroad situations

ScenarioEditor
    - bug fixes

VehicleDynamics:
    - improved calculation of z-acceleration and h/p/r acceleration in simplified and complex 
      vehicle dynamics for externally computed vehicles (here: ego), ticket #5907

License Server:
    - the environment variable "VI_LIC_SERVER_PORT" may be set for a custom port to be used for the
      communication between license server and client, ticket #5851

ModuleManager:
    - each instance of the moduleManager can be given a discrete name identifier, so that status
      messages (SCP Info) can be attributed to different instances; naming is performed via command
      line parameter -n (e.g. moduleManager -n myMM -f moduleManager.xml).
    - the call priority of plug-ins may be prioritized explicitly using an unsigned int value
      default priority is 10000; plugins will be called in the order of an increasing priority value
      (i.e. lowest value first)
      Syntax:
        <Sensor name="...." priority="5000"/>
        <DynamicsPlugin name="...." priority="5000"/>
        <Plugin name="...." priority="5000"/>
        
ImageGenerator:
    - OpenSceneGraph
      - Fix backported some changes to the osgViewer StatsHandler to avoid a data race between cull and draw

    - vigcar
      - Add view based visibility for MovingModels ( vehicles, diguy, ... )
      - Add view based visibility for Symbols

    - libVIGFramework
      - Draw performance changes:
        - Rename all occurences of "u_baseTexture" to "baseTexture"

          !!!!NOTICE!!!!

          This affects all Material definitions using road shaders, ensure that custom Project and Setup specific
          Material xml files are updated accordingly.

        - Merge of various uniform variables to reduce draw time overhead.

      - Fix Material override with multiple assignMaterials calls. Code now duplicates the UserDataContainer to avoid
        indirect override and once again keeps track of assigned Drawables

      - Add experimental support for EGL based headless rendering. This mode is meant for use without active display server (X11).

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) - v.0.1
    - available as beta version in an AddOn package
    
+ --------- SUMMARY end


+ --------- DETAILED section

Documentation:
    - user manuals are now under "Doc/Manuals" 
    - information about 3rd party software is in "Doc/Licensing" 

RDB:
    - version 0x011E
    - introduced RDB_SYNC_CMD_RENDER_TARGET_FRAME in order to request a specific frame from the IG 
      (note: IG must be in SingleThreaded mode for this option to work)

Distribution:
    - VTD will unpack in directory "VTD.2.1"
    - added 'configurationProfile="HIGH_CONTRAST"' to standard script "configureDisplay.sh" which switches the IG
      to the high-contrast databases. This entry may be removed it the new color / material scheme does not 
      fit one's purpose; in that case, the old material database will be re-used
    - removed the "DISPLAY" variable from all "simServer.xml" configuration files; the DISPLAY is to be set by the 
      user explicitly if required, otherwise the environment variable of the shell invoking VTD will be used, ticket #5798
    - project "SampleProject.Legacy" and setup "Standard.Legacy" are no longer part of the distribution
    - the shadow database is no longer required

TaskControl:
    - added command line option "-p" to explicitly not connect to the ParameterServer (required for some headless operations)
    - an additional log file is provided for image files resulting from the conversion of a recording
      into a video; this file will match image numbers with simulation frame numbers and simulation times;
      name and location of the log file correspond to name pattern and location of the temporary image 
      files, but an extension ".log" is added, see ticket #5569
    - traffic goes to "paused" when in pause mode instead of going to "fail", ticket #5681
    - added warning print if friction value reported by a contact point is well out of bounds, ticket #5732
    - TTC is shown at sensor symbols (provided it can be calculated, ticket #5005
      display of TTC and occlusion may explicitly toggled using the following command:
         <Display><SensorSymbols showTTC="true" showOcclusion="false"/></Display>
      per default, TTC is enabled and occlusion is off

    - Hazard light and brake light may be set to flashing mode (high frequency), tickets #5004, 4728
      Examples:
        <Player name="Activator"><Light type="brake" state="flash"/></Player>
        <Player name="Activator"><Light type="emergency" state="flash"/></Player>

    - legacy port 48180 (GSI) is completely disabled per default, ticket #5792
    - the interface for the connection to the ScenarioEditor may be set explicitly, ticket #5793
      <TaskControl><ScVis interface="lo"/></TaskControl>
    - extended ENGINE information is preserved and sent out in the next frame, ticket #5678
    - added boolean configuration parameter "sendTrafficObjectCfgExtOnly" for RDB configuration
      so that the overall message size of RDB may be limited for HiL or SimWB systems

MultiRaySensor:
    - generated and returned ray information is attributed to the correct instance of a sensor plugin, 
      so that multiple instances of the multi-ray sensor may be used concurrently, see ticket #5669

OdrGateway:
    - fixed TCP connection (wrong port was used for sending the results); bugreport via e-mail

SUMO Gateway:
    - the new SUMO version cannot handle spaces in vehicle names correctly. In VTD's conversion script,
      spaces are filled with '#' for SUMO and removed again when names are propagated to VTD

    - added output of traveled distance to CSV conversion of pkg 9, ticket #5906

License Server:
    - the environment variable "VI_LIC_SERVER_PORT" may be set for a custom port to be used for the
      communication between license server and client, ticket #5851

ModuleManager:
    - each instance of the moduleManager can be given a discrete name identifier, so that status
      messages (SCP Info) can be attributed to different instances; naming is performed via command
      line parameter -n (e.g. moduleManager -n myMM -f moduleManager.xml).
    - the call priority of plug-ins may be prioritized explicitly using an unsigned int value
      default priority is 10000; plugins will be called in the order of an increasing priority value
      (i.e. lowest value first)
      Syntax:
        <Sensor name="...." priority="5000"/>
        <DynamicsPlugin name="...." priority="5000"/>
        <Plugin name="...." priority="5000"/>
    - Static obstacles placed in the scenario editor are now correctly taken into account when
      computing the occlusion matrix even if the corresponding filter is not set in the sensor, ticket #5952

ImageGenerator:
    - CarSim
      - Add SharedStateManager
        The SharedStateManager reuses existing osg::StateSets, osg::Uniforms and osg::StateAttributes
        to reduce State update costs during draw. Currently it is automatically used by CarSim::Vehicle
        when declared


    - OpenSceneGraph
      - Fix backported some changes to the osgViewer StatsHandler to avoid a data race between cull and draw
      - Fix since the backported changes did not help fix all issues added a global mutex to osgText::Text


    - vigcar
      - Add view based visibility for MovingModels ( vehicles, diguy, ... )
      - Add view based visibility for Symbols
        Specify viewport masks using -c <cameraName>=<hexmask> for example cam1=0x01
        <cameraName> coresponds to the name given in the CfgDisplay.xml / AutoCfgDisplay.xml
        <hexmask> has to be a subset of -m if also specified


    - libVIGFramework
      - Draw performance changes:
        - Rename all occurences of "u_baseTexture" to "baseTexture"

          !!!!NOTICE!!!!

          This affects all Material definitions using road shaders, ensure that custom Project and Setup specific
          Material xml files are updated accordingly.

        - Merge of various uniform variables to reduce draw time overhead.
        - Disable generation of osg_ViewMatrix, osg_ViewMatrixInverse and osg_FrameTime uniform variables by default.

      - Fix Material override with multiple assignMaterials calls. Code now duplicates the UserDataContainer to avoid
        indirect override and once again keeps track of assigned Drawables

      - Add experimental support for EGL based headless rendering. This mode is meant for use without active display server (X11).
        Currently only supported with the DISPLAY environment variable unset and the display configuration:
             <Graphics threadingModel="SingleThreaded" ... >
               <RenderSurface pBuffer="1" eglBasedContext="1" ... >

        other configurations may crash for various reasons, the support is still experimental.


      - Add LODGeometry class to group geometry with shared state that is normally divided into individual level of detail groups
        to reduces state changes during draw traversal. LOD changes are handled internally by LODGeometry during cull.
        Optimizing osg::LOD and osg::Geometry nodes into vig::LODGeometry objects grouped by osg::StateSet to improve draw time.
        A vig::LODGeometry object can replace a tree of osg::LOD/osg::Group/osg::Geode/osg::Geometry objects.
        Sideeffects:
        (+) Improved Draw
        (+) Reduced overall GPU memory usage
        (-) Increased GPU resource upload for local scenarios
        (-) No buildin support by OSG, special casing sometimes necessary.
      - Add lodAwareDrawablesOptimizationEnabled flag to <Graphics> to globally enable/disable use of LODGeometry objects.
        Default is disabled. No effect for Raytracing profiles where it is always disabled.
        Note: This optimization seems to cause slowdown on some system, for now it has to be enabled on a case to case basis
        in configureDisplay.sh

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) - v.0.1
    - PBR is the most advanced rendering technique for accurate calculations of dynamic light / surface interactions. Usually used for offline 
      rendering and raytracing engines due to its bigger performance impact in comparison to previous methods, PBR is the key to realistic 
      surface representations. The core of PBR consists of measured material properties like roughness, Fresnel reflectance, diffuse color, 
      metallic property and surface normal map in combination with an advanced BRDF function (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). 
      More information about PBR can be found in our documentation.
    - as this is a beta release it contains some bugs and artifacts that will be removed in future releases. A list of known issues will be 
      provided at the end of this section.
    - it is recommended to use a GPU with 8GB Video RAM or greater (M5000M | GTX 1080). GPUs with less RAM will suffer from low frame-rates due to the memory bottleneck. 
      Future releases will focus on a 3-4 GB GPU target (GTX 960 | GTX 970).
    - this version is shipped with a static PBR scene with all included models textured with measured PBR materials to showcase our current 
      progress. 
    - cars/vehicles are rendered with the old approach due to the complexity and time needed when generating PBR models. Future releases will 
      include vehicles.
    - the focus of this release is set on the correctness in the core shader, BRDF calculations and surface reflectivity values all based on 
      measured materials without the need for adjustments in material properties to filter edge cases. Also, it sets a future ground for further 
      improvements and extensions.

    - Following setups are available with this release:
          - PBR: low dynamic range PBR rendering. The output buffer is set to 8bit per channel (RGBA). All input lights (sun and sky included) 
                 are scaled to fit into this smaller range creating unavoidable artifacts in the lower/upper range. Some scaling/adjustment in 
                 intensity of these light sources are also present to counter the mentioned artifacts. This is the fastest rendering at a cost 
                 of a bigger difference to reality.
          - PBR_HDR: High dynamic range rendering with 16/32 bit per channel (RGBA) and REINHARD tone mapping as a final post processing step to 
                     scale pixel values down to the visible range. No adjustments in light intensities are needed in this setup as the lower and 
                     upper range can be visualized correctly.
          - PBR_HDR_LM: High dynamic range rendering with 16/32 bit per channel (RGBA) and LINEAR tone mapping as a final post processing step to 
                        scale pixel values down to the visible range. No adjustments in light intensities are needed in this setup as the lower 
                        and upper range can be visualized correctly by setting a scaling factor to the desired value. 
          - PBR_HDR_CM: High dynamic range rendering with 16/32 bit per channel (RGBA) and false color tone mapping as a final post processing 
                        step to visualize the pixel values as colored luminance values with an adjustable scaling factor. No adjustments in light 
                        intensities are needed in this setup as the lower and upper range can be visualized correctly.

    - known bugs / artifacts / missing features:
          - repetitive objects occur in the static PBR scene due to a relatively small amount of PBR objects available at this point
          - all vehicles are rendered with the old rendering approach due to time complexity needed when generating these models in PBR
          - some textures might flicker a bit since they are overlapped by other textures at the exact same height
          - some buildings might have aliasing artifacts/lines visible due to texture coordinates not matching perfectly
          - some buildings might have small holes in the areas where windows/doors or other objects are located due to geometry not matching.
          - for performance reasons, the reflections rays are shot against a simplified scene that is not rendered with all effects. 
            Due to this limitation, the color sampled from the reflection scene is not correct in some areas and creates artifacts.
          - performance is not perfectly optimized and might vary depending on the scene the camera is looking at, future releases will 
            improve this.
          - shadows are optimized for the ego car camera position, moving the camera around might show artifacts in shadows. Also, objects
            that are far away will not have any shadows due to the limit in the shadow texture resolution and size.
          - at small distances between perpendicular connecting walls (example: a building inner corner - not outer corner) shadows might not be 
            calculated correctly and a lit surface might be calculated instead. This is mostly visible when the sun is at dawn or at sun set 
            and is relatively near the ground. At this time, specular reflections are very strong and highlight these areas since the contrast 
            between a shadow and a specular reflecting surface is the strongest.
          - the current version uses the previous HDR sky model which was calibrated for old rendering purposes. Since the sky model and vehicles
            use the old approach, we had to calibrate the sun and ambient light intensities to match the mentioned models which might not be desired
            in some edge cases. We provided scaling parameters for all parts of the engine to ensure one can calibrate these special cases if necessary.
            The sky will be replaced with a PBR sky in the next version.
          - PBR uses the previous lightning system where the dynamic lights were calibrated to approximate their real values. Still, some precision is 
            lacking and will be replaced with a new lightning system in future releases.

Licensing:
    - the default license file is now "$VTD_ROOT/bin/license.dat", i.e. licenses don't have to be provided per setup; 
      existing installations may, however, continue to use the old location (ticket #4998)

ScenarioEditor 2.0.3:
    - support for speed units in OpenDRIVE
    - support for lane types "entry" and "exit" 

GhostDriver 2.0.3:
    - ActionNominalTrajectory
        optional lateral offset

    - support for speed units in OpenDRIVE
    - support for lane types "entry" and "exit" 

TaskControl / ModuleManager:
    - introduced performance / real-time monitoring for debugging purposes; the nominal and actual frame times are being compared;
      with monitoring active, TC will also send RDB message @RDB_PKG_ID_PERFORMANCE@, so that external entities can monitor
      the real-time behavior of the taskControl

      Example:
         <RealtimeMonitor entity="taskControl" active="true" tolerance="0.1" verbose="true" live="true"/>

         entity: "taskControl" or "moduleManager" 
         tolerance: fraction of nominal frame time that is tolerated before issuing a warning message
         verbose: if true, output is a bit more detailed
         live: if true, permanent monitoring data will be reported in shell

    - simulation frame numbers may be displayed concurrently with speed and simtime (TC debug option @simFrames@), ticket #5023

    - the traffic module may be paused and resumed while the simulation (TC, IG etc.) continues to run. 
      commands:
          <Traffic><Pause/></Traffic>
          <Traffic><Start/></Traffic>

    - the currently loaded scenario file may be queried:
          Query:
              <Query entity="taskControl"><Scenario/></Query>

          Answer:
              <Reply entity="taskControl">
                  <Scenario contentViaSCP="false" filename="/home/marius/Data/vtd/VTD.2.0/Data/Projects/Current/Scenarios/Demo.xml" />
              </Reply>

    - ticket #4966: the taskControl may be configured to automatically invoke a start script (SCP script) upon availability of all components

    - the display of a pop-up notification at the start and end of a video generation procedure may be turned off, so that
      the GUI remains accessible. The configuration parameter is @<TaskControl><Video showNotification="false"/></TaskControl>@

SensorPlugin:
     - occlusion information of objects is calculated in a more reliable way, even objects close to each other at a far
       distance can be clearly distinguished (various tickets)
     - a new filter "laneInfoComplete" has been introduced which will have the sensor plug-in report ALL lanes at a given
       position, not only the drivable ones (for which the filter "laneInfo" may still be used)

VehicleDynamics:
     - modified default "moduleManager.xml" in Data/Distros/Distro/Config/ModuleManager so that only one vehicle dynamics
       plug-in is active (the "old" one). There has been a risk of ambiguity in certain cases;

ScpGenerator:
     - waits for established connection before starting to send; this is important in "autoConfig" mode where the TC may not yet 
       be ready but the scpGenerator may already have been invoked; note: this functionality has to be enabled explicitly by providing 
       command line argument "-w" 

OdrGateway:
     - the OdrGateway now also supports relative positioning. 

ImageGenerator:
     - the environment (weather) control via SCP has been extended; you may now simulate "purple rain" and put the sun at 
       any convenient location or modify its appearance, tickets #5213, #5215 and #5216

       Commands:

         <Environment>
             <Precipitation type="rain" intensity="2.0" particleSpeed="8" particleSize="0.06" particleColor="0.8 0.8 0.8 1"/>
         </Environment> 

         <Environment>
           <Sun override="true" azimuthDeg="135" elevationDeg="6" 
                ambientIntensityScale="1.0" diffuseIntensityScale="1.0" specularIntensityScale="1.0" 
                modelSizeScale="1.0" modelIntensityScale="1.0"/>
         </Environment>

       For more information and pictures, see the FUSC section of the Wiki.

     - The camera offsets applied to a view(port) within a render surface may be modified during run-time, ticket #5220

       Command:

         <Camera name="abc">
             <Offset dx="1.0" dy="1.0" dz="1.0" dhDeg="0.0" dpDeg="0.0" drDeg="0.0"/>
             <Set channel="0x01" view="cam01" />
         </Camera>

       You may use this command to modify, for example, the views of a stereo camera within a single render surface during run-time. 

    - SCP commands
      - PostProcessing uniforms can be changed (#5221)
        - <ImageGenerator><PostProcessing><Step name="Final"><Uniform type="int" name="counter" value="1" /></Step></PostProcessing></ImageGenerator>

ScenarioEditor 2.0.3:
    - support for speed units in OpenDRIVE
    - support for lane types "entry" and "exit" 
    - fixed road mark visualization
    - minor bug fixes

GhostDriver 2.0.3:
    - ActionNominalTrajectory
        optional lateral offset
        parameters endAction, targetS and lateralOffset are now changeable during run time
    - simplified driver steering torque output
    - reduced lower limit of steering distance
    - night start and night stop are now configurable (for automatic headlight activation)
    - minimum delta distance is now configurable for steering path query
    - support for speed units in OpenDRIVE
    - support for lane types "entry" and "exit" 
    - minor bug fixes

TaskControl / ModuleManager:
    - introduced performance / real-time monitoring for debugging purposes; the nominal and actual frame times are being compared;
      with monitoring active, TC will also send RDB message @RDB_PKG_ID_PERFORMANCE@, so that external entities can monitor
      the real-time behavior of the taskControl

      Example:
         <RealtimeMonitor entity="taskControl" active="true" tolerance="0.1" verbose="true" live="true"/>

         entity: "taskControl" or "moduleManager" 
         tolerance: fraction of nominal frame time that is tolerated before issuing a warning message

         live: if true, permanent monitoring data will be reported in shell

    - simulation frame numbers may be displayed concurrently with speed and simtime (TC debug option @simFrames@), ticket #5023

      commands:
          <Traffic><Pause/></Traffic>
          <Traffic><Start/></Traffic>
       Note: another config parameter of the TC (<TaskControl><Traffic maxPlayerAge="-1"/></TaskControl>) must be set, so that
             the TC does not remove the (inactive) traffic players automatically

    - the currently loaded scenario file may be queried:
          Query:
              <Query entity="taskControl"><Scenario/></Query>

          Answer:
              <Reply entity="taskControl">
                  <Scenario contentViaSCP="false" filename="/home/marius/Data/vtd/VTD.2.0/Data/Projects/Current/Scenarios/Demo.xml" />
              </Reply>

    - ticket #4966: the taskControl may be configured to automatically invoke a start script (SCP script) upon availability of all components
      and after having processed the command "<SimCtrl><Apply/></SimCtrl>" (e.g. by starting VTD via "bin/vtdStart.sh -autoConfig")
      the script has to be named "tcAutoStart.scp" and has to be in the format of an scpGenerator script; in addition, the 
      command line argument "-S" has to be provided in the taskControls entry within the "simServer.xml" file; the auto-start script
      "tcAutoStart.scp" may be located either in "Data/Setups/Current/Config/TaskControl" or in "Data/Projects/Current/Config/TaskControl" 

      alternatively (i.e. without having to modify the file simServer.xml), VTD may also be invoked using "bin/vtdStart.sh -autoStart" 
      the attribute "-autoStart" has the same effect as the command line argument "-S" in the taskControl's process configuration
      and it includes the "-autoConfig" functionality

    - the display of a pop-up notification at the start and end of a video generation procedure may be turned off, so that
      the GUI remains accessible. The configuration parameter is @<TaskControl><Video showNotification="false"/></TaskControl>@

SensorPlugin:
     - occlusion information of objects is calculated in a more reliable way, even objects close to each other at a far
       distance can be clearly distinguished (various tickets)
     - a new filter "laneInfoComplete" has been introduced which will have the sensor plug-in report ALL lanes at a given
       position, not only the drivable ones (for which the filter "laneInfo" may still be used)

VehicleDynamics:
     - modified default "moduleManager.xml" in Data/Distros/Distro/Config/ModuleManager so that only one vehicle dynamics
       plug-in is active (the "old" one). There has been a risk of ambiguity in certain cases;
       if you want to use the more sophisticated vehicle dynamics, just create a copy of the "moduleManager.xml" file for
       your individual setup or project, de-activate the "old" entry and activate the "new" one.

Multi-ray Sensor:
     - the sensor's output "RDB_SENSOR_OBJECT_t" will report the inertial co-ordinates of the hit point with minimum distance
       to the sensor's origin, ticket #4718

ScpGenerator:
     - waits for established connection before starting to send; this is important in "autoConfig" mode where the TC may not yet 
       be ready but the scpGenerator may already have been invoked; note: this functionality has to be enabled explicitly by providing 
       command line argument "-w" 

OdrGateway:
     - the OdrGateway now also supports relative positioning. When sending the resulting co-ordinates of your vehicle dynamics to the taskControl
       with the flag @RDB_COORD_TYPE_RELATIVE_START@, the you should also query the contact points from the OdrGateway by adding the flag
       @RDB_ROAD_QUERY_FLAG_RELATIVE_POS@ to the member @flags@ in @ROAD_QUERY_t@. Upon receipt of the first external player's coordinates
       in relative mode, the taskControl will issue the command

         @<Set entity="odrGateway" id="id_of_player"><PosInertial x="x_reset_pos" y="y_reset_pos" z="<_reset_pos" h="h_reset_pos"/></Set>@

       and, thus, define the start point for the OdrGateway. You may, of course, issue this command also by yourself if you want to use 
       a different reset position (per default, the initial position of the player as defined in the scenario is transmitted).

ImageGenerator:
     - the environment (weather) control via SCP has been extended; you may now simulate "purple rain" and put the sun at 
       any convenient location or modify its appearance, tickets #5213, #5215 and #5216

       Commands:

         <Environment>
             <Precipitation type="rain" intensity="2.0" particleSpeed="8" particleSize="0.06" particleColor="0.8 0.8 0.8 1"/>
         </Environment>

VTD 2.0.2, 26.05.2016
---------------------

+ --------- SUMMARY start

RDB 0x11b <----- ++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++
    - started support for generic dynamic switches and degrees-of-freedom
        - introducing RDB_DYN_EL_SWITCH_t and RDB_PKG_ID_DYN_EL_SWITCH
        - introducing RDB_DYN_EL_DOF_t and RDB_PKG_ID_DYN_EL_DOF
    - introducing road position flag RDB_ROAD_POS_FLAG_OFFROAD
    - added FOV offsets for sensor information RDB_SENSOR_STATE_t (converted two spares)
    - added RDB_PKG_ID_IG_FRAME and RDB_IG_FRAME_t
    - converted first half of spare in RDB_TRIGGER_T into member "features" to limit update to certain subset of the modules
    
Distribution:
    - pedestrians have been upgraded to DI-Guy 13.1
    - CRG objects (speed bumps, pothole etc.) are included in the basic distribution

Documentation:
    - the wiki has been extended considerably within the following sections
        - Advanced Setups
        - FUSC
        - Configuration
        - ModuleManager (description of available plug-ins)
    - other sections have seen minor updates

ParamServer:
SimServer:
    - minor bugfixes
    - relative positioning of data files (e.g. OpenDRIVE, OSGB) supported if variable VTD_ROOT is set

ScenarioEditor 2.0.2
    - DI-Guy 13.1

GhostDriver 2.0.2
    - DI-Guy 13.1
    - major driver improvements for large junctions
    - new action "ActionRelativeSpeed"
    - new DriverBehavior setting "overtakingDecisionDist"
    - objects and vehicles are now placable at different z-positions (e.g. different levels in parking garage)
    - lane validity for signals is handled correctly
    - stability (in terms of "fluency") for driving in cities has been improved considerably

Complex Dynamics 0.9.26
    - many minor improvements in the dynamics and power train calculation
    - joystick operation is possible now
    
Dynamics Plugins:
    - when querying a road position, the inertial position's z co-ordinate is taken into account,
      thus enabling the vehicle e.g. to drive through multi-level parking garages
    
Module Manager:
    - a major memory leak in the sensor class has been removed
    - a list of loaded plug-ins may be queried:
        new command: <Query entity="moduleManager"><Plugin/></Query>
    - recorded position data may be played back during the simulation
        new plugin: libModuleDynFromFile
    - plug-ins in MM instances running slower than the simulation frame rate may be 
      configured to process the last received RDB frame only (MM command line option "-l")
    - the sensor for detecting roadmarks on a geometry basis (i.e. in the viewing frustum) 
      has been improved considerably. A new plugin "libModuleRoadmarkCnCSensor" is provided
      (in the wiki, look for "Extended Roadmark Sensor")
    - the sensor frustum may be defined as a "wedge" instead of a "cone"; the shape of the
      horizontal cross section through the wedge may be given by a texture, thus providing
      a means for highly detailed modeling of sensitive zones within a sensor.
      (in the wiki, look for "Custom Sensor Shapes")
    - simulation time of each SCP command may be reported together with the command; this
      functionality may be acticated in the TC configuration:
        <TaskControl><SCP addSimTime="true"/></TaskControl>
      (in the wiki, look for "Time-stamping of Commands")
      
Sound:
    - the indicator of the Ego vehicle has been added as sound sample

TaskControl:
    - offroad positions of vehicles are reported on RDB in the ROAD_POS structure
    - recordings may be performed in a memory ring-buffer and this buffer may be
      directly replayed or dumped to file if applicable; by this you can have a
      permanent history which may be written to file whenever the user decides that
      a certain situation and its previous simulation steps (of configurable length)
      are "interesting"
      (in the wiki look for "Recording to a buffer instead of a file")
    - the time-of-day limits for specifying "night" may be set individually by the
      user:
         <Environment><TimeOfDay nightStart="68400.0" nightStop="25200.0"/></Environment>         
      During "night shift" e.g. vehicle lights will be turned on automatically
        
      
Image Generator:
    - FramebufferReader
      - Support Audio Video Interleave format (i.e. .avi file extension) -> use VTD videos "as is" on Windows machines!

    - vigcar
      - Fix inconsistent use of simFrameNo and simTime.

    - DI-Guy
      - Updated to DI-Guy 13.1.0 to fix skinning issues of some models

      - Allow to change the OptiX layout SHM key per IG instance
      - Default key (RDB_SHM_ID_CUSTOM_01) can be changed via the RDBInterface component configuration.

    - Shadows
      - Add maxShadowRange parameter for StandardShadowMap technique

    - PrecipitationEffect
      - Fix Rain and Snow in paused simulation (#3302)

VTD 2.0.1, 24.01.2016
---------------------
++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x011a !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

DETAILED INFORMATION

RDB 0x11a:
    - added RDB_FREESPACE_t and RDB_PKG_ID_FREESPACE and RDB_FREESPACE_STATE
    - converted one spare in OBJECT_STATE_EXT to "traveledDist"; this contains the traveled distance 
      of a dynamic object since the start of the simulation
    - added RDB_DRIVER_INPUT_VALIDITY_MODIFIED to tag a driver control command which is a combination of
      an original command and an add_on command
    - modified some parts of RDB_CUSTOM_TRACK_CTRL_xxx structures / definitions
    - added RDB_PKG_ID_CUSTOM_LIGHT_B and RDB_PKG_ID_CUSTOM_LIGHT_A
    - converted spares in ROADMARK info to "laneId" and "roadId"
    
Several issues with the ParameterServer have been resolved and it will now be possible to perform proper 
configuration of a setup's taskControl using the ParamServer GUI

Parameter Server:
    - new policy for configuring TC (and other components in the future) using the parameter server:
        - if a file "vtdParamServerAutoLoad.stp.xml" is found in "Data/Setups/Current/Config" then this
          file will be automatically loaded by the ParamServere upon start of the simulation

Distribution:
    Sensors:
    - the first perfect sensor as defined in the file "Data/Distros/Distro/Config/ModuleManager/moduleManager.xml"
      is now called "DefaultPerfectSensor" (previous name: "perfect")
    - output of "DefaultPerfectSensor" is set to TCP, port 48195; the sensor is persistent
    
    Databases:
    - German town database has been updated:
        - debugged graphics
        - default projection info in OpenDRIVE file

    Plugins:
    - added "libModuleBaseSample" as test module for
        - deriving a module directly from the base class "ModulePlugin"
        - exchanging data between two modules
        - see also ticket #2014
        
    Develop:
    - added Modules/BasePlugin as example of a plugin derived from "ModulePlugin" and
      for illustrating the data exchange between two plugins
        - configuration in moduleManager.xml:
              <Plugin name="producer">
                  <Load     lib="libBasePlugin.so" path=""/>
                  <Debug    enable="false"/>
              </Plugin>

              <Plugin name="consumer">
                  <Load     lib="libBasePlugin.so" path=""/>
                  <Source   name="producer"/>
                  <Debug    enable="false"/>
              </Plugin>
        - see also ticket #2014
    - added routine "getUserDataSize()" to modulePlugin base class.
    
    Project: SampleProject:
    - included Parking example in Databases and Scenarios
    - added test scenario for two external vehicles
        
    Setup: Standard.noIG
    - fixed configuration files, see tickets #4078 and #4115
    
    Tools:
    - added tool "VehicleController" which may be used for controlling an externally
      computed vehicle (e.g. Ego) via keyboard. It uses SCP commands for performing
      this control. You may invoke the tool as follows:
      
          usage: vehicleController [-p:x] [-s:IP] [-n:name]

           -p:x      Remote port to send to
           -s:IP     Server's IP address or hostname
           -n:name   name of controlled vehicle (default: Ego)
        
        Example: ./vehicleController -p:48179 -n:Ego
        
      The shell where you started the tool will go blank; while keyboard focus is
      within the shell, you are able to use the four cursor keys to control the 
      vehicle.
      
      see also ticket #3755

VTD 2.0.0 - RC1, 28.09.2015
----------------------------
++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x0119 !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

MAJOR CHANGES:
- all components are compiled as 64bit executables; 32bit systems are no longer supported
- introduction of SimServer; 
  - task configuration is performed in a single config file instead of various files
- introduction of ParamServer: 
    - taskControl configuration is performed by GUI, no longer by setup file
    - other components will follow
- introduction of "config" stage; 
    - tasks (starting with TC in this release) have a distinguished 
      "config" stage where basic parameters may be set before the tasks are activated; after "applying" the
      configuration settings (e.g. by pressing the "apply" button in the GUI), all tasks will be in the
      same stage as in VTD 1.x after executing "load components"
- image generator is run in "high contrast sky" mode by default
- new sky model in IG
- new visual databases are provided in ".osgb" format; the former ".ive" format is deprecated
- new vehicle dynamics for operation by VIRES driver (not by mockup yet)
- VTD is to be started via bin/vtdStart.sh and stopped via bin/vtdStop.sh
- selectSetup.sh has been moved to bin/selectSetup.sh


DETAILED INFORMATION

RDB 0x0119
    - added RDB_VEHICLE_LIGHT_FORCE
    - added "temperature" to RDB_ENVIRONMENT_t (traded one spare for it)
    - added "temperature" and "oilTemperature" to RDB_ENGINE_EXT_t (traded remaining spares)
    - added "fuelGauge" to VEHICLE_SYSTEMS_t
    - introduced new gear box positions
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_C
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_MS
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_CS
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_PS
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_RS
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_NS
      RDB_GEAR_BOX_POS_DS
    - converted spare in RDB_OBJECT_STATE_BASE_t into two configuration parameters,
      which will render sending the "heavy" package RDB_OBJECT_CFG_t unnecessary in
      certain cases
          cfgFlags
          cfgModelId
      in order to guarantee backward compatibility with existing implementations, the
      flag RDB_OBJECT_CFG_FLAG_MODEL_ID_VALID has to be set if the member "cfgModelId"
      is to be interpreted
    - introduced RDB_PKG_ID_CUSTOM_OBJECT_CTRL_TRACK and associated structure
    - introduced members "neutralPos" and "dampingMaxTorque" in package RDB_DYN_2_STEER_t
    - added further vehicle light identifiers "RDB_OBJECT_TYPE_VEH_LIGHT_xxx"
    - introduced "RDB_CUSTOM_TRACK_CTRL_FLAG" class for custom use case (temporary solution only!!!)
    - introduced RDB_COORD_TYPE_TRACK for position information; this will be used for the output of dedicated sensor
      plugins only; it describes the position (speed/accel) of an object in track co-ordinates with the members of the 
      position structure used as follows:
        x = s-coordinate [m]
        y = t-coordinate [m]
        z = relative z [m]
        h = relative heading [rad]
        p = relative pitch [rad]
        r = relative roll [rad]

TaskControl 4.0.0:
    - projection may be altered after reading an OpenDRIVE file by explicitly stating proj4 projection string and a shift of
      the inertial origin
      
      <SimCtrl><LayoutFile originX="aaa" originY="aaa" originZ="aaa" proj4CfgInertial="+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"/></SimCtrl>
      
    - introduced new protocol for IG communication "precision11" which will send a dynamic number of joints per pedestrian
    
    - there may be conflicting sources for the state of a vehicle's light mask; therefore, the flag RDB_VEHICLE_LIGHT_FORCE has been 
      introduced. If OR'd to the member "lightMask" in "RDB_VEHICLE_SYSTEMS_t", only incoming messages of type "RDB_PKG_ID_VEHICLE_SYSTEMS"
      will be allowed to modify a player's light mask
      
    - gear may be set from external component via RDB DRIVER_CTRL message
    
    - Some contents of the message _RDB_OBJECT_CFG_t_ have been moved to _RDB_OBJECT_STATE_BASE_t_:

            * the members _cfgFlags_ and _cfgModelId_ have been added to _RDB_OBJECT_STATE_BASE_t_
            * the flag _RDB_OBJECT_CFG_FLAG_MODEL_ID_VALID_ has been introduced
            * if the flag _RDB_OBJECT_CFG_FLAG_MODEL_ID_VALID_ is set in the member _cfgFlags_, then the member _modelId_ is valid and may be used (this has been done in order to ensure backward compatibility)
            
            With the new structure, a standard use case of VTD (including dynamics for player "default" in ModuleManager) can now run *without* the object configuration message). Therefore, network load should be reduced significantly.
            
            For disabling the object configuration message in your setup, change the TC settings (typically in @Data/Setups/Current/Config/TaskControl/taskControl.xml@) as follows
            
            <TaskControl>
                :
                <RDB ... sendTrafficObjectCfg="false" ... />
                :
            </TaskControl>
            
    - Record/Playback may now be based on RDB/SCP recordings; this provides significantly more flexibility and provides easy-to-process record files;
      for enabling, edit the TC-configuration as follows:
            <TaskControl>
                :
                <RecPlay ... mode="RDBandSCP"  showInfo="true" ... />
                :
            </TaskControl>
            
      Note: with "showInfo" set to "true" the progress will be shown in the lower left corner during replay
      
    - added position offset upon receipt of RDB data
           

ModuleManager 4.0.0:
    - projection may be altered after reading an OpenDRIVE file by explicitly stating proj4 projection string
      <SimCtrl><LayoutFile proj4CfgInertial="+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"/></SimCtrl>
      
    - understands command for adding a signal to an already loaded database, e.g.:    
         <SimCtrl>

            <Add>

Image Generator

- CarSim:
  Add fallback for unknown vehicle templates and vehicle models
  Warning now issued once instead of every frame if the vehicle template
  and Entity MissingCarVIRES exist.

- Networking:
  Change Package handling.
  The ordering check performed to deal with UDP ordering issues would consistently
  drop all packages for the first sim frame after entering RUN state.

- VIG-OptiX
  - Sky is disabled on all ray tracing profiles
  - DI-GUY 13 does not contain all previous models in a non skinned mode
    Hardware skinned pedestrians can not be supported (there is not optix similar skinning shader)
  - Sample sensor modifications
  -- OptiX sample (visual spectrum)
     Replaced sky with an environment map
     Known Bugs:
        current miss implementation does not handle correct sky intersection and lighting

- Absolute database file path informations are logged using the DEBUG notify level

- Synchronize OSG based feature extensions (precipitation) with the extern (e.g. TC's) simulation time
  I.e. rain and snow was not synchronized and hence, not deterministic reproduceable.
    -- known bugs: precipitation effect disapears if simulation is paused

- Remove old protocol handling
  - VTD Setups should have precision10 or newer set in the taskcontrol.xml
    protocols of type standard[08] are no longer handled

- Component Picker (key 'i')
  Rearange OSG node path hierachy for an intersection

- Remove OpenSceneGraph support having a major version number less than 2
  Note: affects only really REALLY old VIG's, which do not work with VTD.2.0 at all.
 
- File format changes
  - Upgrade tooling to better support osgb files
  - ive is still supported however some features may only work
    with osgb database files and models. 

- Library changes

   - Minimal support for version 13 complete (feature parity with DI-Guy 10)
   - !!Notice!!
    - No version for 32 bit
    - No vendor support for Open SuSE 11.2 - library incompatibility prevents use
      Tested for Open SuSE 12.1, 13.2
    - Not compatible with DI-Guy 10
      VTD should be configured to use the same DI-Guy version for all components

- Oculus RIFT
  Add VIGOculus lib to support Oculus RIFT integration
  - Support requires current kernel interfaces
    Tested for OpenSuSE 12.1, 13.2
  - Requires libudev
    To enable Oculus copy the provided rules file into
    /etc/udev/rules.d/ and call udevadm trigger
  - Requires oculusd to be running
    May require a symlink to libudev.so.0
  - !ATTENTION!: The Oculus SDK license requires that all users of the
    Oculus RIFT have to be informed of possible risks. Use the provided
    documents to do so.
  - !ATTENTION!: The Linux and Mac SDKs are no longer maintained
  - !ATTENTION!: The current implementation still has issues meeting

    - Remove osg Node names ( does not apply to osgSim DOFTransform/MultiSwitch ) some tools spam them
    - Remove "empty" UserDataContainers
    - Merge known comments/properties when feasible
    - Share duplicate UserDataContainers
    - Share duplicate arrays
    - Merge MatrixTransform, Group, LOD, Geode and Drawables
    - Comments should now be reliably retained and can interfere with optimization
    - Replace osgconv with igconv -- osgconv does not handle osgb correctly
    - Replace osgdb_openflight.so with custom plugin, osg optimizer would discard comments

 - Improve LocalLights
   - !!NOTICE!! some older hardware/driver versions may no longer be supported,
     you can check the output of glxinfo for the following openGL extensions

   - Add property field to MaterialAssignment ( property="Tunnel")
   
- Improve TunnelRenderer
   - Use "VTDProperty:++Tunnel" comment to mark geometry for specialized materials
   - Deprecate .TUNNEL. textures, new databases should no longer use them for memory
     and performance reasons. Still supported for legacy reasons.

 - (Internal) New Signal/Object control interface for VTD
   - Comments starting with VTDDynamic* are now interpreted by the IG
   - Relies on XML definitions of logic and messages for the different
     objects.

     Requires that the FramebufferReader is configured after the Camera component
     For VTD the configuration in the file Setups/Common/Config/CommonIGConfig.xml
     has to be adjusted so that the FramebufferReader elment appears after the Camera
     element.

     <Camera ...>
         ...
     </Camera>
         ...
     <FramebufferReader ...>
         ...
     </FramebufferReader>

         addCustomPackage(...)
    
TaskControl.3.8.0:
    - contact points may be visualized, see #3021, 
    Example:
        <ContactPoint id="0" > <PosPlayer player="Ego" dx="0.0" dy="0.0" /> <Show/> </ContactPoint>"
        <ContactPoint id="1" > <PosPlayer player="Ego" dx="2.0" dy="0.9" /> <Show/> </ContactPoint>
        <ContactPoint id="2" > <PosPlayer player="Ego" dx="2.0" dy="-0.9"/> <Show/> </ContactPoint>
        <ContactPoint id="3" > <PosPlayer player="Ego" dx="0.0" dy="-0.9"/> <Show/> </ContactPoint>
        <ContactPoint id="4" > <PosPlayer player="Ego" dx="0.0" dy="0.9" /> <Show/> </ContactPoint>
    - driver which sends pedals instead of targets may be configured so that maximum steering wheel rate is taken into account,
    Example:
        <Player name="Ego"><Driver sendPedals="true" maxSteeringWheelRateDeg="150"/></Player>
        
    - introduced Wheel control via SCP, Examples

            <Player name="xxx"><Wheel id="3" angularSpeed="auto" radius="aa.bb"/></Player>
      note: if wheel information for the same wheel is received via RDB, the wheel will go into automatic
            mode and apply the rotation angle as received via RDB            
    - forwarding motion system information directly to IG
    - fixed a bug with the speed of replays (#3220) - internal routines were sometimes too slow

ModulePlugins:

        <Filter objectType="roadMarks" tesselate="true" tesselateOffsetZ="0.02" .../>
        :
      </Sensor>
      
TrafficDyn:
    - re-enabled bodyPitchScale and bodyRollScale
    - introduced "bodyPitchSmoothing" and "bodyRollSmoothing" for smoother body motion in high acceleration conditions

     Be Careful!! Increasing the local lights count (default 24) will end up with a significant performance drop.
     e.g. <Graphics ... isLocalLightingEnabled="1" maxNumLocalLights="20" ... >

 - GLSL conformance (Bug #3007)
   - Support NVIDIA 346.35 by inserting #define statements after the #version tag
     Note this currently uses a simple string search and requires that

ScenarioEditor 1.7.0:
    - corrected typo in GUI, break light -> brake light (#2688)
    - fixed trailer positioning bugs (#2623 and #2624)
    - support for displaying PathShapes with a large amount of points (#2298)
    - introduced a search dialog for object definitions (#2205)
    - displayed PathShapes and Paths no longer disappear on simulation start (#1747)
    - updated the SCP GUI

GhostDriver 1.7.0:
    - new feature "persistent relative road positioning" (#2708)
    - SCP query <TrackPos> now also working for pedestrians (#2634)
    - new SCP query <Counter> for querying counter values (#2585)
    - fixed bug which appeared when using <Set><PosRelativeRoad>, <Set><SpeedRelative> and <ActionDistance> together (#2538)
    - speed and acceleration are no longer reset to zero after setting players to a new position with SCP command <Set> (#2464)
    - pedestrians are now walking exactly to the end of their path instead of stopping 0.0m - 0.5m before path end (#2446)
    - fixed misinterpretation of SCP command <Environment><TimeOfDay> without attribute "value" (#2420)
    - fixed pulk player placement if "own side" 0% or 100% is selected (#2385)

    - corrected some information in the model description (#2553)
    - added material assignments for missing light materials (e.g. flashlight) (#2479, #2474)

ImageGenator:
    - GLSL Compliance
      - Correct shaders missed during the 1.4.0 release
      
    - PostProcessing
      - Increase limit on texture inputs for each Step to 6
      - Add clearColor to PPSTextureRect to override default 
      - Add experimental support for Multi Render Targets to PPSTextureRect
    
    - Symbols
      - Add HUD3DStep and HUD3DCubeStep to integrate world space Symbols with 
        PostProcessing.
    
      Note: Symbols produced by the vigSymbols plug-in appear black when processed
      by the HDR pipeline, they neither emit nor receive light. The added steps 
      allow separate processing to avoid this when required.
    
      Note: Additional steps only exist if both Symbols and PostProcessing 
      components already exist at preLoop().
      
      Note: Text symbols are not implemented for cube map rendering 
    
    - Replace old Light approximation for increased accuracy.
      - default OpenGL light model to local viewer
      - default shader computations to local viewer
    
      Note: old opengl and some of our shaders defaulted to an optimized light
      model where all objects are shaded as if they where centered in the view.
      This lead to increasingly wrong specular highlights for objects not centered
      in the view and physically wrong behavior when the camera was rotated in 
      place. Depending on the project settings this difference may be nearly non
      existant or extreemly visible (HDR with a CubeMap lens).
      
      Note: to restore the old behavior insert a IGLightModel tag into the IG
      configuration as shown bellow:
      
      <SystemConfig>
           <IGLightModel model="InfiniteViewer" />
      </SystemConfig>
      
      !!ATTENTION!!: If there are problems with the new light model please contact
      us, the IGLightModel setting and code modelling the old light model will likely
      be removed with VTD 2.0 if the new model is sufficient.
    
    - Communication settings
    
      Adding multicast port type for incomming (TC) and outgoing (trigger) data.
      Note: Multicast requires a multicastServerAddress
    
      <TAKATA name="TAKATA"
           ...
           trigger="Multicast"
           dataPortType="Multicast"
           multicastServerAddress="230.0.0.1" />
    
      dataPortType/trigger:
       - TCP (default),
       - UDP,
       - Multicast
    
       - Adjust material definitions
         - Add LDR materials for lights, ventilators and road marks inside of a tunnel.
    
       - Several styles are marked to not cast any shadows.
         Fixes a bug (flickering) at the road shoulders.
    
     RDB video data (i.e. snapshot feature)
    
     The RDB message layout of a snapshot (via net, shm or file dump) is extended by camera informations of type RDB_CAMERA_t. I.e.
    
     RDB_MSG_HDR_t
       RDB_MSG_ENTRY_HDR_t     (e.g. color)
         RDB_IMAGE_t
         ImageData
       RDB_MSG_ENTRY_HDR_t     ( NEW )
         RDB_CAMERA_t
    
       RDB_MSG_ENTRY_HDR_t     (e.g. depth)
    
    - Materials
      - Change of assignments for traffic signs in order to fix problems with some signs
      - Introduction of experimental materials for HighContrastSky
      - Assignment of materials for flashlights now possible

    - Shortcuts:
        - Ctrl + w : toggle 'Wireframe Mode'
        - Ctrl + o : toggle 'Occlusion Visualizer'



VTD 1.4.0, 24.06.2014
---------------------

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x0115 !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

Distribution:
    - New material system: With the new material system, the materials are extracted from the vehicle definition. A vehicle template of a vehicle config file only sets the material assignment for a vehicle part (e.g. red for the car paint or glass for the window). The material database then defines all materials for NormalSky, HDR and IR. In this way a vehicle can be displayed with NormalSky, HDR and IR materials without changing the vehicle config files. (#2032)
          o Update of all material assignments in the vehicle config files
          o Update of all materials in a new file: BaseVehicleMaterials.xml
          o Added materials and material assignments for HDR and IR materials
          o Visually revised all HDR materials (#2171,#2198)
    - Added correct positions for the headlights in order to set the right position of light sources in the IG (#1751)
    - New model description tag in the vehicle config files: The model description provides information about the model .ive file of a vehicle. It gives information of positions of light sources (#443), mirrors (#1504) and eye points (#1503). It also describes all switchables of the vehicle (e.g. driver, lights) (#2058)
    - Added new setup (Standard.HDR) for the simulation in HDR (#1730)
    - in all Setups the taskControl.xml was modified. The line "<Traffic controlHeadlights="true" />" has been added. This implies that
      the traffic takes over the control of the lights for the internal cars.  
    - updates SCP test scripts, deleted some of them
    - added excerpts of Redmine Wiki to documentation in directory Doc/Wiki
    - added HDR version of town database
    - IG32 is no longer part of the distribution
    - moved post processing XML configuration (i.e. <PostProcessing ... />) from CommonIGConfig.xml to PP required setup configuration files

Traffic in general:
    - New trigger condition: absolute speed (#2296)
    - New feature: permanent lane offset (#1896)
    - Fixed bug in clothoid calculation (#2036, #2037)

ScenarioEditor 1.6.0:
    - Measuring tool improved (#2172)
    - Properties dialog shows vehicle features: Position of eyepoints, light sources and mirrors; available model switches (#2059)
    - Status line additionally shows z-coordinate (if available) of mouse position (#2017)
    - New (optional) warning message, if loading an old scenario (#1990)
    - Updated traffic-relevant parts of the SCP GUI

GhostDriver 1.6.0:
    - Collision is also calculated for cars without driver (#2161)
    - Optional automatic z-coordinate determination for inertial PathShape waypoints (#2062)
    - Optional continuous ground clamping for character PathShapes (#2062)
    - Improvements for ActionDistance:
          o ActionDistance is no longer limited to neighbor lanes and short distances (#2052)
          o Controller behavior has been improved and controller gains are now modifiable via SCP (see SCP documentation for ActionDistance)
    - Lateral distance control with the new ActionLateralDistance (#1950)
    - Improved end actions for PathShapes (ActionNominalTrajectory):
          o "continue" works now also together with junctions (#2000)
          o Previously activated Routes are continued after interrupting them by PathShapes, instead of autonomous continuing (#1951)
          o End action "loop" is now working also for PathShapes (#1871)
    - ActionNominalTrajectory allows controlling the waypoint sequence: ascending (default), descending or auto (#1948)
    - Indicators of trailers are working now correctly
    - Driver behavior can now be adapted to the type of vehicle (#1837)
    - Improved driver recognition of objects and pedestrians, especially on or near junctions (#2350, #2107)
    - Trailers can now be placed without tractor (#2004)
    - Lighting management is done by traffic now. In auto mode (SCP: Environment -> TimeOfDay -> headlights) lights turn on, depending on time, in tunnel, in case of low visibility or precipitation (#2135)
    - Fixed bug in wrong character placement (heading turned by 180 degrees) (#2005)
    - Improved adherence to road marks, like solid lines (#2099, #2126)
    - Actions created via SCP allow now setting the activation event ("On Enter" or "On Exit", like in ScenarioEditor) (#2023)
    - The InfoAction of triggers contains now the trigger position (#2194)

Image Generator:
    - Support new TC<->IG protocol having double precision positioning data (instead of single precision).

    !!! ATTENTION - OSG UPDATE !!!
    - Now, VIG links against OSG 3.2.1 rc-3 libraries (bug in current version and stable 3.2.0)
 
    - Adjust material definitions
      - Add material definition for trashcan (LDR)
      - Add material definition for traffic sign text

    - LightingManager
      - Enable override support for light definitions equal to the MaterialManager
      -- i.e. fixed hierachy
              1. Definitions at: .../VIG/data/BaseMaterials
              2. overwritten by: .../SETUP/Config/ImageGenerator/SetupLights.xml (Optional)
              3. overwritten by: .../PROJECT/Config/ImageGenerator/ProjectLights.xml (Optional)

    - OptiX-SDK
      - Add TCP (as Server) network support
      -- e.g. <RDBInterface ... >
                <NetCom name="OptiXNetIface"
                        type="TCP"
                        serverPortNo="50738" />
              </RDBInterface>
      - Remove project specific (non standard) RDB structure for Plugin OptiXPluginExample
      -- Instead all OptiX buffer will be converted to RDB messages of type RDB_Image_t

    - PostProcessingPipeline
      - Add outputSlots for PostProcessingSteps, each step may now provide multiple named output textures that can be referenced
        by name (default slot:color)
      -- e.g. <TextureInput inputNo="0" sourceStep="PreviousPPS" outputSlot="color"/>
      - Add optional outputSlot "depth" for the depth buffer to PPSTextureRect and PPSCubemapTexture. This can be enabled using
        generateDepthTexture="1"
      -- e.g. <Step type="PPSTextureRect" name="GetSubImage" generateDepthTexture="1">
 
    - GLSL Compliance
      - Adjust shaders to validate with current Nvidia Drivers (331.67)

TaskControl 3.7.1:
    - debugged handling of <SimCtrl><Command/></SimCtrl> (internal use only)
    - handling also DriverInput with gear "N"
    - copying values for velocity and acceleration to "hard-linked" players (the ones with relative, perssistent positioning to a pivot)
    - debugged image transfer via SHM (adhoc version 3.6.40, #2379)
    - for players receiving VEHICLE_SYSTEMS messages, the headlights will no longer be overwritten by the headlights check box in the GUI
    - added "emergency" as symbolic light state
    - sending light sources in idle state (#1774)
    - ID of engine starter sound may be specified in TC configuration (will be activated if defined and EGO rpm changes from 0 to something)
        <TaskControl>...<Sound ... starterSound="5"/>...</TaskControl>
    - incoming wheel flags propagated to output
    - increased time-out for RDB image output port to 2s
    - calculation of road marks and collection of signal information by TC is now really off per default; this task should be done via sensor plugins to the MM;
      for legacy purposes, roadmark calculation in TC may be turned on again with <TaskControl><RoadInfo enable="true" roadMarks="true" .../></TaskControl>
    - debugged gear selection for joystick mode
    - joystick buttons may be assigned SCP commands in the TC configuration file (on the same level as <Axis> tags)
        Example:
            <Button id="7" cmd="<SimCtrl><Stop/></SimCtrl>" />
    - increased maximum number of joystick buttons to 32
    - drawing multiple sensor cones in different colors
    - debugged un-initialized structure in team mode
    - transferring also driver info via GSI for coupling mode
    - as for players, also cameras may be queried: (#2199)
        Example 1:
            <Query entity="camera"/>
                will result in a list of replies, one for each camera, e.g.
                <Reply entity="camera" id="0" name="default1" />
                <Reply entity="camera" id="1" name="Default Eyepoint_CAMERA" />
        Example 2:
            <Query entity="camera" id="1"/>
                provides info about the queried camera, e.g.
                <Reply entity="camera" id="1" name="Default Eyepoint_CAMERA" />
                
            the same may be achieved by querying for the name instead of the id
            <Query entity="camera" name="Default Eyepoint_CAMERA"/>
                <Reply entity="camera" id="1" name="Default Eyepoint_CAMERA" />
        Example 3:
            <Query entity="camera" id="5"/>
                if the corresponding camera is not found, the reply will directly reflect the query
                <Reply entity="camera" id="5" />
    - IG comm interface may be set individually via attribute "interface"
    - IG portType may be set to "MultiCast" (#1005)
    - control of vehicle lights may be shifted to traffic module via TC configuration file:
        <TaskControl>
        :
          <Traffic controlHeadlights="true" />
        :
      This will enable the traffic to control lights of parking cars, cars in tunnels etc. according to the situation
    - IG snapshots may be masked, i.e. limiting snapshots to certain channels (#2133)
        Example:
            <Video><Output name="myImage" path="/tmp" /><Start snapshot="true" channel="0x4"/></Video>
            
        Further information:
            http://217.92.240.170/projects/vtd/wiki/VTD_FAQ_ImageGenerator#The-safe-and-flexible-way-via-SCP
    - SHM configuration is forwarded to IG upon INIT even if no external sync mask has been queried (#2379)
        
SensorPlugin:
    - fixed bug concerning preview length for tesselated road marks if attribute tesselateFixedStep="false" has been set  (#1984)
    
TrafficDyn:
    - trying to filter incoming driver input values for reasonable range, especially avoiding NAN and INF
    - rear driving light mask is cleared before re-computing the state (#2264)
    
ModuleManager:
    - MM may run in frame-sync mode, i.e. performing one internal update each time a full RDB frame has been received. By this,
      quick response to incoming messages is guaranteed and overall latency shall be minimized. In order to activate the frame-sync mode,
      provide a dt of 0.0 as command line argument:
        moduleManager -t 0.0 -f moduleManager.xml
        
CrashSensor:
    - Objects for which a crash is detected may be defined as filters (see also see "Object Filtering" in http://217.92.240.170/projects/vtd/wiki/FAQ#CrashSensor)
      Per default, all possible collisions will be detected. Upon definition of the first filter, the user has to provide filter entries for all object 
      types that are of interest. The filter definitions have to be provided within the <Sensor> definition. Two different filter types are available:
       1) Standard VTD objects (e.g. players)
            Each filter definition consists of two attributes: rdbCategory and rdbType. The valid values for these attributes are given in the RDB interface file.
            Example (will react on entities of category PLAYER and type CAR only):
                <Filter rdbCategory="RDB_OBJECT_CATEGORY_PLAYER" rdbType="RDB_OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER_CAR"/>
            Omitting the rdbType will add a filter for all objects of the given category
            Example (will react on all entities of category PLAYER):
                <Filter rdbCategory="RDB_OBJECT_CATEGORY_PLAYER"/>
        2) OpenDRIVE objects
            Objects defined in the OpenDRIVE file may be of designated types which are not part of the RDB specification. Therefore, the desired types of these objects may be provided as plain text as they also occur in the OpenDRIVE file.
            Example (will react on OpenDRIVE objects of type "road"):
                <Filter odrType="road" />
        Within one <Sensor> definition, multiple Filters may be defined.(#1359)

VTD 1.3.5, 20.02.2014
---------------------

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x0114 !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

RDB:
    - added "flags" in RDB_WHEEL_BASE_t and associated definitions
    - added various player type definitions 
      
TaskControl:
    - showing also master info in team mode
    - fixed bug if record button is pressed after INIT button
    - player visibility message may be buffered until player is available
    - introduced "<TaskControl><Traffic legacyPedestrianInit="true / false"/></TaskControl>; 
      set this feature to true in order to operate pre-1.3.4 IG with 1.3.4 TC and pedestrian simulation
    - SCP via UDP may be activated by setting the environment variable SCP_COPY_ON_UDP to an integer value other than zero
    - bugfixed computation of co-ordinates of symbols with relative orientation
    - VTD driver may also send pedals instead of targets
        <Player name="nameOfPlayer"><Driver sendPedals="true"/></Player>        
    - new debug option "trajectories" to visualize steering trajectories in 3d
    - RDB send buffer is limited to 50MB; if a stream exceeds this limit, it will be closed and memory space will be released
    - fixed interpretation of wheel messages for more than four wheels in one message
    - introduced debug option to display the names of all players in the IG
        <TaskControl><Debug playerNames="false"/></TaskControl>
    - added further information upon offroad event
        <SimCtrl><Assessment reason="offroad" continue="auto"/></SimCtrl>
    - added sync configuration option for RDB / SCP triggered operation (for certain installations only!)
        <TaskControl><Sync waitAfterFrame="true" ..../></TaskControl>
      if true, the frame sync will wait directly after the current frame, before triggering the next traffic frame;
      upon receipt of a trigger, simTime will be increased, traffic will be triggered and simulation will wait again until a message
      from traffic has been received; this does not provide the highest frame rate due to slightly higher latency but it will be more consistent
      in terms of the increase of the simulation time; per default this option is OFF
    - static wheel radius for externally computed vehicles is transferred correctly to RDB-out
    - traffic lights may be set to flashing via TC (internally only, no SCP command yet)
    - added calibration vector for brake / throttle pedal input per player (translates acceleration values into pedal positions)
      calibration vector may consist of as many entries as necessary for the description of the behavior(min. 2)
      works only if pedals are requested for a driver instead of acceleration values
      very simplistic approach, does not take current speed into account
        Syntax:
            <Player name="nameOfPlayer"> <Driver lookupThrottlePedal/lookupBrakePedal="[accelValue1,pedalPos1] [accelValue2,pedalPos2]....."/> </Player>        
        Example:
            <Player name="Own"> <Driver lookupBrakePedal="[-10.0,1.0] [-5.0,0.5] [0.0,0.0]"/> </Player>
            <Player name="Own"> <Driver lookupThrottlePedal="[0.0,0.0] [5.0,0.8] [6.0,1.0]"/> </Player>
    - global friction scale factor is propagated to contact points
    - visualizing switch state for railroad switches even when operated by preparation panel
    - querying player configuration is now a bit more flexible:
        Examples:
            Query a specific player:    <Query entity="player" id="1"/>
                                     or <Query entity="player" name="Ego"/>
            Query all players:          <Query entity="player"/>
    - debugged SHM access
    - Video Recording: keepImages-flag as received by GUI / SCP is now interpreted correctly
    - simulation may be run in single step mode
        As in replay, one may now also specify during standard operation the number of steps that have 
        to be performed until the execution goes into pause mode;

        command:
            <SimCtrl><Step size="3"/></SimCtrl>

        if issued in pause mode, the indicated number of steps will be executed before the system 
        goes back to pause again; if issued in run mode, the indicated number of steps will be executed 
        and then the system will go into pause mode; without the attribute "size", only one simulation 
        frame will be executed.
    - a p-i-p mirror channel in the IG may be turned on/off
        <ImageGenerator><MirrorConfig enable="..." name="..."/></ImageGenerator>
    - camera image will not show rain if camera is positioned in tunnel (and tunnel is referenced in OpenDRIVE file)
    
ModuleManager
    - ports of sensors may be queried globally
        Example:
            <Query><Port/></Query>
            answer:
            <Reply><Sensor name="perfect"><Port name="RDBout" number="48195" sendego="true" type="TCP"/></Sensor></Reply>
    
SensorPlugin:
    - surround sensor may be specified by not providing left/right/bottom/top values of <Frustum>; objects are selected according to near/far plane only
    - corrected sometimes wrong skipping of static objects upon entry into SENSOR_OBJECT list 
    - corrected calculation of roadDist in RDB_TRAFFIC_SIGN_t
    - shape of sensor frustum may be given as additional attribute; current sensors only work for unspecifiec shape or for shape "standard"
        <Frustum shape="standard" near="0.0" far="100.0" left="45.0" right="45.0" bottom="10.0" top="10.0" />
      For test implementation only: cylindrical frustum (only some plugins provide this feature!)        
        <Frustum shape="cylinder" near="0.0" far="100.0" radius="1.0" verbose="true" />
    - debugged SHM access
    
CrashSensor:
    - debugged C++ type mismatch in output of crash object type

ghostdriver:
    - Backwards driving via ActionSpeedChange (works on roads without junctions and path shapes of ActionNominalTrajectory)
    - Improvements in Pulk traffic:
        * The pulk cars can be initialized at the beginning
        * The area between the pulk radius and the inner radius describes the area where cars will be added. Before, this value was always 15 meters.
           So, cars were only added in the area from pulk radius to pulk radius - 15 meters.
        * Pulk traffic is now available for more than one player.
    - Traffic/ActionTimeTable:
        * path shape is set for the action, no ActionNominalTrajectory needed anymore
        * added attribute sync mode for synchronisation with time or way progress of the master player
        * added commands for stopping, pausing and continuing the action
    - Traffic/ActionAutonomous: added attribute for disabling autonomous mode
    - Set/PosRelative: added attribute for persistent relative positioning of objects (not vehicles)
    - Set/PosTrailer: sets the correct position for trailers
    - Query/ListScenarios: provides a list of scenarios in the current project
    - Query/GetScenario: provides the content of a queried scenario file
    - Path/Delete: path shapes (polyline and spline) can be deleted via SCP
    - Object types introduced
    - Vehicles with "NO DRIVER" assignment will not show the driver in the graphics
    - Bugfixing

scenarioEditor:
    - New pulk traffic dialog
    - Select particular element of many overlapping elements with a longer click
    - Zoom direction is editable in the editor settings
    - Improvements in the edit position dialog
    - Introduced distance measuring tool
    - Introduced $owner as pivot for selection actions
    - Shortcuts for showing path (W) and path shapes (E)
    - Bugfixing


VtGui:
    - SHM as protocol for sensor
    - selection of active scenario
    - removed show ego msg  
    - recordings directory set to absolute path
    - trains as player
    - Limitation of popup windows


VIG Build (VTD 1.3.5)
    - RDBInterface
      - Snapshots taken from the framebuffer (normal rendering, not RTT) resize the window dimension to the viewport
        and disable window decorations to avoid image corruption

    - PostProcessingPipeline
      - Add GL_R16 and GL_R32F as new RTT bufferFormats
      - Add vert. and frag. shader to crop sub images
        (i.e. start at [uStart,vStart] from PreviousPPS texture and crop subImage having dimension (RTT width and height))
      -- e.g. <Step type="PPSTextureRect" name="GetSubImage" >
                <Inputs>
                    <TextureInput inputNo="0" sourceStep="PreviousPPS" />
                </Inputs>

                <Program    vertexShader="../data/Shaders/defaultPositionAndTextureCoords.vert"
                            fragmentShader="../data/Shaders/subImageRectangle.frag" >
                            <Uniform type="sampler2D" name="imageSource" value="0" />
                            <Uniform type="float" name="uStart" value="300" />
                            <Uniform type="float" name="vStart" value="100" />
                </Program>

                <RTT  sizeMode="explicit" width="600" height="400" bufferFormat="GL_R32F" />

                <SAQ lowerLeftX="0.0" lowerLeftY="0.5" width="0.5" height="0.5" isForDebug="0" enableSRGB="0" />

                <Readback readbackThreadAffinity="3" />
              </Step>

    - All IG profiles use the same material management system now. Previously, vehicle material properties were taken from the XML files that
      define the vehicles (/Distros/Current/Config/Players/Vehicles ) in standard IG profile. In HDR and Raytracing profiles, however,
      the newer and more capable material manager was used. Here vehicle definition XMLs do not contain material information but instead a
      reference to a material in material database.
      - The older method is not used anymore. All IG profiles use the material database.
      - Some materials are removed, some new ones are added and some are renamed. Users who override existing materials or assign their
        own materials to certain vehicle parts need to update their materials accordingly (e.g. change name or target of the material)
      - Mixing the two material systems required maintaining different sets of player configuration XMLs for cars. Some VTD projects where
        HDR or RayTracing profiles are used had their own Vehicle definitions. These are removed now. All projects use Vehicle definitions
            from Distro.

    - headlightLightGeomRadiance parameter is removed from IGBase xml's. This parameter is not supported anymore and must be removed.
      Headlight radiances should be modified using the appropriate material (e.g. EmissiveHeadlightGeom_HDR) in ProjectMaterials.xml.

    - Material management for DIGUY characters changed. Previously, materials were assigned using texture names onto DIGUY pedestrians. With the
      new system, each DIGUY character receives a material target ID automatically and can be referenced with this ID by the material manager.
      The ID is a string as follows: "DIGUY_" + appearance. For example, for bob_suit appearance ID is "DIGUY_bob_suit". A single line MaterialAssignment
      command suffices to assign materials to all DIGUY pedestrians. Example:
      <MaterialAssignment target="DIGUY*"  material="DIGUY_HDR" description="HDR" isActive="0" />

    - Performed several optimization for OptiX. There is a new IG configuration profile , RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM, that must
      be used for sensors such as radar, lazer or ultrasound.
      - The IG profile is usually set by configureDisplay.sh scripts. To use the new profile RAYTRACING string must be replaced by RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM
      - A new Setup called Optix.NonVisualSpectrum is added using RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM profile.
      - Vehicle wheel animations are disabled in RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM profile.
      - Lights are disabled in RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM profile.
      - LOD's are disabled in RAYTRACING_NON_VISUAL_SPECTRUM and RAYTRACING profiles.
      - The default texture is now yellow.

    - Exception color is made red for OptiX. A red pixel will be shown in case there are errors in computing certain rays.

    - Add debug configuration for OptiX exception handling.
      - See OptiX docu (OptiX_API_Reference_xxx) for a list of exception codes.
      - Exception codes can be concatenated by space delimeter.
      - Config example:
          <OptiXPluginName name=...>
            <DebugConfig enableRTPrint="0" exceptionCodes="RT_EXCEPTION_ALL" />
          </OptiXPluginName>

    - VIG-OptiX SDK
      - OptiX may be used as a inital PPS having a input texture source named "OptixOutputBuffer"
      - call OptiXPluginLib base functions instead of copy-paste code (error-prone)
      - OptiXPluginExample:
      -- disable INTERRUPTRENDERING showcase per default

Tools:
    - Installation/checkLibs
        - uses search path for required libraries; for system-specific settings, edit the script and modify the variables
              SEARCH_PATH32 and
              SEARCH_PATH64
          accordingly.
    - ScpGenerator:
        - accepts multiple "wait" statements within one script file
        
    NEW ITEMS:
    - ModelConverter (Runtime/Tools/ModelConverter)
        - Added this tool so that the user can convert own 3d OpenFlight-models to v-IG compliant .ive files
        - For details, see the "readme.txt" in the tool's directory
    - RDBSniffer(Runtime/Tools/RDBSniffer, some distributions only):
        - may also analyze recorded files
    
Distribution:
    - "stopTasks" now calls SIGINT instead of SIGTERM (due to problems with some OS versions)
    - added "Tools/ModelConverter" for the conversion of 3d models to IVE
    - added objects for parking spaces (some distributions only)
    - added user-selectable license plates to vehicle models
    - removed headlight entries from trailers
    
Doc:
    - scenario schema file added 
    - updated ScenarioEditor manual
    - RDB / SCP doc updated   

Development Environment:
    RDBHandler:
        - renamed shm handling routines, so they are labeled more consistently        
    Module/DummyDriver:
        - added example plugin for sending driver control information into VTD via a MM plugin
    

// General changes in configuration an setups:
    Distro/Config/ImageGenerator/LightSrcStd.xml:
        - render target textures size has been increased
        - attribute "lightDistributionEffectOnAmbientIntensity" has been introduced; this is required for the light system to
          comply with the appearance of the "old" light system; this attribute is a bugfix for effects that occured already in VTD 1.3.4
 
    Distro/Config/ImageGenerator/LightSrcStd.xml:
        - new file "IGConfig.xml" which holds the reference to the basic configuration files
 
    Distro/Config/Players/Vehicles:
        - license plates have been added to all vehicle configuration files

    Distro/Databases/Players/Objects:
    Distro/Databases/ObjectsCommon:
        - added parking space objects and boards for testing

    Distro/Databases/Cars:
        - vehicle models have been replaced with more recent ones that support different license plates
 
    Distro/Databases/Town:
        - added tunnel entry in OpenDRIVE file "townWithRainAndObjects.xodr"
 
    Setups/Common/Config:
        - added common IG configuration information
 
    For all setups:
        Config/ImageGenerator/AutoCfg.xml has been modified to include the basic configuration file first (as provided in Distro)
        and afterwards the Setup and Project-specific configuration files

ghostdriver:
    - New clothoid function in openDrive manager
    - Selection groups from scenarios are supported
    - Traffic/ActionNominalTrajectory:
        * action looks for the path shape the whole path and not only at the beginning
        * added attribute radius for finding the path shape
        * added attributes startS, targetS and endAction {continue, stop, loop}
    - Traffic/ActionTimeTable:

        * added attribute factor that is multiplied on the speed
    - Traffic/ActionSpeedChange
        * added attribute player for getting the rate of pivot player
        * attribute rate is added to acceleration of player

    - Traffic/LeftHandTraffic: new commando for changing to left-hand traffic (only works fine in init mode)
    - Player/LaneOffset:
        * added attribute time for adjusting the time for the lane offset change (depending on speed at call time)
        * added attribute s for adjusting the distance for the lane offset change (depending on speed at call time)
        * added attribute relative for offset change relative to current offset
        * attribute absolute changes always the offset relative to 0
    - Set/SpeedRelative: new commando like speed but with relative speed to pivot
        * with attribute pivot the speed of pivot player is read
        * value is added to the read speed of pivot and set to the player
    - Query/RightOfWay: query the right of way given by road signs or traffic signals within a viewing distance
    - Query/Routing: query the planed route of the driver with a given precision
    - Reply/RightOfWay: provides the right of way given by road signs or traffic signals within a viewing distance
    - Reply/Routing: provides the planed route of the driver
    - Bugfixing

scenarioEditor:
    - Rotation of multiple selected objects:
        * left mouse + space -> rotate position around red selection cross
        * right mouse + space -> rotate heading of all elements
    - Loading and saving scenario templates via right mouse menu in order to extract specific situations of a scenario:
        * save objects, players, characters and actions to a scenario template file
        * load these elements in same alignment at a different place of a different scenario
    - Position type PathShape in properties of a player available:
        * like position type path
        * adjustable startS, targetS and endAction {continue, stop, loop}
    - User-defined selections for players, characters or objects in scenario properties:
        * add/delete of selections groups in scenario properties

    - Update of several new actions in the SCP gui
    - Bugfixing


taskControl 3.6.37:
    - counting number of messages arriving at a given connection
    - IG config message will be re-sent also to late-coming image generators if dynamic player config is enabled
    - debugged (again) removal of expired players
    - traffic light states may be set directly via RDB
    - driver: testsPedals, testSteering
    - sending of sensor outputs may be delayed  <SensorPlugin><Output delayMs=""/></SensorPlugin>
    - forwarding wheel state also of internal players to RDB
    - shut down all MasterPort and SlavePort connections
    - new query for entire player configuration:
        <Query entity="traffic"><PlayerDef/></Query>
      reply is
        in case of failure: <Query entity="imageGenerator"><ImageGenerator><PlayerDef/></ImageGenerator></Query>
        in case of success: <Query entity="imageGenerator"><ImageGenerator><PlayerDef>....</PlayerDef></ImageGenerator></Query>
    - forcing c-locale
    - removed smoothing of throttle input in joystick mockup
    - strong changes in sound parameters may be avoided by configuring TaskControl:
        <Sound .... loadArbitration=[0.0..1.0] .../>
      0.0: no arbitration, all parameters are played directly
      1.0: only old values are used (this setting doesn't make too much sense)
    - new debug option "signalMask=0x00000000" to force all signals into a given mask
      a specific signal can be switched by also providing the attribute "signalId"
      Example:
        <TaskControl><Debug signalId="112" signalMask="0x10100000"/></TaskControl>
    - Query for RDB sync mask takes effect immediately, so that no additional free run frame is given
    - setting flag RDB_VEHICLE_LIGHT_INDICATOR_LAMP_ON on RDB output
    - added attribute "syncToShm" for live video transfer via SHM, so that TC can run independently of any transferred images
    - bugfixed default load arbitration of sound interface
    - added <TaskControl><RDB driverCtrlPlayer="nameOfPlayer"/></TaskControl> to restrict sending of
      driver controls to a single player and, thus, compensate a bug in veDYNA
    - bugfixed indicator control
    - template information of a player may be queried:
      Examples:
        <Query entity="player"><Template id="5"/></Template>
        will be replied as: <Reply entity="player"><Template id="5" name="Audi - A3 - red"/></Reply>

        <Query entity="player" name="Ego"><Template/></Template>
        will be replied as: <Reply entity="player" name="Ego" id="1"><Template id="2" name="Audi - A6 - blue"/></Reply>
    - model ID of player configuration data is filled correctly
    - light source frustum may be set via SCP without strong dependency of near clipping plane
      by providing angles directly (default signs are also derived from the indicated directions):
        <LightSource ....>
            <Frustum leftDeg="aaa" rightDeg="bbb" bottomDeg="ccc" topDeg="ddd" near="1.0" far="100.0"/>
        </LightSource>
    - sending vehicle configuration to IGs which are started after the original message has been sent
      is handled on a per-client basis instead of a broadcast to all IGs
    - player visibility in reference to a camera is now handled within the camera class itself; for cameras
      which are attached to a player, the user may specify this player's visibility using the attribute "showOwner";
      this information is kept with the camera, so if the camera is re-activated, the same settings for the
      owner visibility will be applied
      SCP example:
        <Camera name="Eyepoint SlowCar_CAMERA" showOwner="false"/>
    - for a delayed handling of offroad conditions, an invisible border may be added globally to all roads in
      the taskControl configuration file: 
      Example (add a 5m border on either side of each road):
      <TaskControl>
        :
        <Dynamics       syncMode="frame"
                        inhibitOffroad="false"
                        offroadBorder="5" />
      </TaskControl>
  
scpGenerator:
    - option -M now also enables monitoring (so you don't have to specify -m -M)

DummyDynTraf:
    - may be initialized with speed != 0
    - interprets also direct setting of speed at run-time
    - corrected computation of angular rates
    - may use brake scaling

Sensor Plug-in:
   - output delay may be specified per sensor
       <Sensor>
        ..
        <Output delayMs="xxxx"/>
       </Sensor>

ModulePlugin:
    - input of a sensor plug-in may be taken from the output of other plugins (sensor fusion)
    - sensor update times may be specified as multiples of MM update times
      Example (sensor is computed at max. every 10th step of the MM):
      <Sensor name="perfect" type="video">
        <Load     lib="libModulePerfectSensor.so" path="" persistent="true" />
        <Config   updateRatio="10" />
        :
  
RDBHandler:
    now also with message parser
    
ImageGenerator
    - VIG-OptiX Optimization
      Upgrade OptiX to version 3.0.1 (Kepler GK104,GK107 & GK110 GPU's are now supported)
      Upgrade CUDA to version 5.0.35
      Town scenario works again
      Bugfix enable sm architecture > 1.3

    - Added a new feature to Symbols subsystem thay allows for using contents of RDB shared memory buffers as symbol textures. This feature can be
      used to stream videos, HUD etc. into the 3D world using conventional SCP interface. See:
      http://viresftp.dyndns.org/projects/vtd/wiki/VTD_FAQ_ImageGenerator#How-do-I-define-a-new-symbol
 
    - Improvements on shadow rendering:
      - Artifacts that are observed at low sun elevations are reduced. There are still problems due to the reduced resolution in case the camera and
        sun direction vectors are parallel, however, artifacts that result are ignorable in many cases.
      - Added support for Standard Shadow Maps which is useful in multi-camera configurations (e.g. cube map based fisheye projection implementations)

    - Precipitation effect supports snow now. Note that PrecipitationEffect configuration format has changed. Standard VTD XML's are updated.

    - Flexible number plates for cars are supported. It is possible to define a number plate in a vehicle template XML now. For the moment only VW Golf 2010
      supports this feature.


VTD 1.3.3, 26.07.2013
---------------------

RDB:
    - corrected bug in version number
    
Distribution:
    - Default project now works with new lighting system
    
Documentation:
    - updated manual of ScenarioEditor


VTD 1.3.2, 16.07.2013
---------------------

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x0110 !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

RDB:
    -  added RDB_PKG_ID_TRAJECTORY and accompanying definitions
    -  added OpenGL conform RDB image pix formats
       old formats now deprecated
    -  added RDB_OBJECT_VIS_FLAG_RECORDER
    -  added RDB_COORD_TYPE_RELATIVE_START
    -  added empty or cast definitions for
           RDB_END_OF_FRAME_t
           RDB_START_OF_FRAME_t
    -  added RDB_OBJECT_CATEGORY_OPENDRIVE
    

Distribution:

    - For special installations, current Setup, Project and Distro directories may be set explicitly via environment
      variables (e.g. in envSettings.cfg); this affects all tasks except for the image generator

        VI_CURRENT_SETUP
        VI_CURRENT_PROJECT
        VI_CURRENT_DISTRO

    - Fixed size of Cube model (now it really is 1.0m per edge instead of 0.5m)


ImageGenerator:
    - New lighting system is functional in multiple configurations. Most of the VTD Setups modified to use the new ligthing system for
      high-fidelity ego headlights and also traffic car headlights.
      - Format for defining headlights in HeadlightFactoryies changed. <Headlight> must be replaced with <HeadlightProjectedTexture>
        (legacy headlight implementation) or with <HeadlightVIGLighting> (new headlight implementation). Some VTD projects which have
            this problem may work once after start but will give a fatal error after a stop/start.

      - Textures that are used as light distributions have to be in RGB format for the new headlight implementation. RGBA format is not
        supported anymore (except for RGBA encoded float case).
 
 
    - Optimizations in the lighting system.
    - Headlights of Autonomous cars and the ego car are rendered using the new lighting system now. A new setup, Standard.Legacy, is added
      for users who wish to use the older system.
    - RDB
      - Add OpenGL conform RDB image pix formats
      - Old pix formats now deprecated
      Note:
            @ SHM based light map input (e.g. LightmaskManagerPlus)
              - Change rdb pix format to RDB_PIX_FORMAT_RGBA8
            @ Snapshot
              - Output now conform to new rdb pix formats (e.g. RDB_PIX_FORMAT_RGB_32F -> RDB_PIX_FORMAT_RGB32F)

taskControl:
    - new pos type "RDB_COORD_TYPE_RELATIVE_START" supported which allows vehicle dynamics simulation to start at 0/0/0 without
      respect of the actual position of the player in VTD at the start; this feature is not encouraged for standard simulation
      where all positions should be consistent but may be used for testing
    - reduced symbol debug prints in IG debug option
    - maximum IG termination time is 3 secs; afterwards, VTD will re-start the IG automatically
    - SCP commands may be re-buffered (internally)
    - fixed query for inertial position of a player
    - players are channel objects now, i.e. may be sent per IG channel
    - bugfixed "maxPlayerAge" setting to -1
    - introduced <PosRoad roadId="" s="" t="" dz=""/> for inertially positioned symbols; initial orientation will be perpendicular to road
    - fixed inertial orientation of symbols
    - added - internally - setting of player pseudoId (<Player name="sss"><Config pseudoId="123"/></Player>), for particular application
    - bufixed calculation of roadmark information (legacy operation of TC)
    - fixed orientation of Ego wheels in preparation mode, as well as indicator, brake etc.
    - harmonized shared memory mechanisms of TC, IG and MM

scpGenerator:
    - added command line option "-M" which enables printing of long messages without truncation
    
libModuleCrashSensor:
    - added crash sensor plugin for module manager. Upon detection of a crash, this sensor will send an SCP message in the following manner:

VTD 1.3.1, 30.04.2013
---------------------

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x010F !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

Distribution:
    Distro:
    - added motorbike "Zx9r" to vehicle database
    - updated Golf VI model
    - updated townDB (light in tunnel, street lights etc.)
    - updated Crossing8 and trafficUK demo
    Setups:
    - updated video conversion scrpt for offline video generation
    - IGbase.xml-files have been updated 
      (entry <Plugin file="RDBInterface" /> has been removed because RDB is integral part of core application now)

taskControl.3.6.32:
    - introduced SHM interface for RDB. Configure as follows in taskControl.xml:
        <RDB name="default"
             enable="true" 
             portType="SHM" 
             imageTransfer="false"
             send="true"/>
                                                          
        <RDB name="shmIn"
             enable="true" 
             portType="SHM" 
             imageTransfer="false"
             receive="true"/>
             
      The shared memory IDs will be RDB_SHM_ID_TC_IN for the direction into TC and RDB_SHM_ID_TC_OUT for the direction out of TC.
      Default sizes will be RDB_SHM_SIZE_TC
      Additional segments may be configured by using other names and explicit configuration of "key" and "size" (see RDB documentation)
      Currently only single-buffered SHM segments are supported. TC will lock the segments while writing to them.
      Bi-directional SHM segments will not be supported, i.e. for each direction there MUST be a dedicated SHM segment.
    - Time-of-day change may be "slewed" (see SCP documentation)
    - Waiting for termination of IG connection before re-starting IG; this should solve the problem of premature
      sending of IG config messages
    - debugged composition of WHEEL_INFO if extended data isn't available from outside
    - cameras may be addressed per IG channel (only camera position and orientation)
      <Camera ....><Set channel = "0x8"/></Camera>
    - introduced debug option "RDBhex" for hex dump of messages (works only if the 
      other debug options "RDBin" or "RDBout" are active)
    - introduced debug option "SHM" RDB shared memory communication
    - validity mask of DRIVER_CTRL commands may be overwritten.

      Default sizes will be RDB_SHM_SIZE_TC
    - forwarding incoming messages to the plug-ins for customized processing

TrafficDyn.2.11.0:
    - computing basic WHEEL_INFO and DRIVETRAIN_INFO
    - debugged handling of light masks

PerfectSensor.2.11.0:
    - optional fixed tesselation for road marks

Framework 2.11.0:
    - added SHM communication
    - extended RDBHandler with several routines for SHM handling    

IESConverer 1.3.0:
    - sub-set of files may be converted using the following command line arguments
      
            -l angleMinH angleMaxH angleMinV angleMaxV
            
      all angles are in DEG.

ScenarioEditor 1.4.0:
    - automatically removes deleted elements in connected mode
    - added some sign icons
    - for triggers net distance can be chosen
    - clears external trigger edit line for other trigger types
    
Ghostdriver 1.4.0:
    - deletion of tractor and trailer players enabled
	- deletion of objects
    - ActionDistance can be deactivated and also restarted
    - swarm traffic: instead of creating default vehicles a warning will be created for non-existing types
    - driving according to time table based on PathShapes
    - warning about invalid driver control override
	- for triggers the net distance between players can be used
	  (calculation is based on minimum distance between oriented bounding boxes)
	- driver reacts to pedestrians and objects that are not hidden for traffic

ImageGenerator:
    - RDBInterface component is part of the IG core now. There is no RDBInterface.so file anymore. References to it must be removed from XML files.
      (  <Plugin file="RDBInterface"/> must be removed from XML's but the RDBInterface component declerations must remain)    
    
    - Extended PostProcessing to support XML based configuration of post processing pipelines. It is possible to load shaders, configure screen aligned quads, buffer formats etc. in
      XML w/o programming. Some changes in API occured to support this feature:
     - PostProcessingStep classes must use IGPPSTEP_IMPL and IGPPSTEP_DECL macros in impementation and headers. These contain the required code that allows us to create and configure
       instances of post processing steps in XML. IGPPSTEP_DECL contains a constructor and a destructor decleration. Both of these must be implemented (even if the implementation is empty),
       otherwise a linker error during build or plugin load time will occur.
     - Post Processing Steps must be registered to PostProcessing component using registerPPStepClass method now.
     - PostProcessing::addOriginalSceneStep is renamed as addOriginalSceneStepTexRect and accepts a name argument for the step name. Previously the name was hardcoded as OriginalScene.
     - See the PluginExample (Demo.VIGPlugin in VTD) in the SDK for an example. 

    - Extended PostProcessing (actually PPSTextureRect) to support loading 2D look-up table files and convert to texture buffers to be used in shaders

    - Warping component removed, instead PPSWarpingStep is introduced. The latter also uses a different file format (VTD users can look at ProjectIGConfig.xml of
      the SampleProjectWarping project). Previous implementation had around 4ms rendering overhead for Full HD. PPSWarpingStep reduces this to 1.4ms.

    - Enhance vehicle model by front and rear bumper handling. 
      Note: A model requires a bumper object separation (currently, only for model 'VWGolf_2010').
      Configuration: For material assignement please add or modify follow xml elment of your 'VehicleTemplate' declaration.
        <Bumpers>
          <FrontBumper ID="MY_FRONT_BUMPER_MATERIAL_ID" />
          <RearBumper ID="MY_REAR_BUMPER_MATERIAL_ID" />
        </Bumpers>
        
    - added specific ReleaseNotes to IG64/doc and IG32/doc


VTD 1.3.0, 26.02.2013
---------------------

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

        RDB revision has changed. It is now 0x010E !!!!

++++++++ ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION + ATTENTION +++++++

Distribution:
    - added some vehicles to database (VW-Distro only)

Tools:
    - added "Runtime/Tools/Installation/checkLibs.sh"; with this tool, the user may
      check whether the required libraries for all VTD components are available on his computer
      
TaskControl.3.6.29:
    - Symbols may be positioned relative to a player using the player's id instead of its name
    - using OdrMgr 1.3.12
    - introduced realTimeFactor as attribute for <Sync>
    - retrieving pathS for player, if available
    - propagating inhibition of force feedback
    - solved start-up problems (2x <Set> etc.)

ModulePlugIns 2.10.0:
    - using framework 2.10.0
    - plugins may interpret incoming SCP data by themselves
    - bugfixed roadmark calculation in intersections

TrafficDyn 2.10.0:
    - accepts dynamics parameters for own vehicle as defined in the scenarioEditor

ScenarioEditor 1.3.0:
    - supporting vehicle and object databases consisting of multiple files
    - ability to receive a scenario completely via SCP
    - transmitted scenarios can be edited and saved to file again
    - supporting new vehicle indicator light and lever state for visualization
    - scenario elements can be assigned to layers whose visibility can be switched
    - new driver behavior control "use of indicator"

Ghostdriver 1.3.0:
    - driving closed looped paths smoothly
    - supporting vehicle and object databases consisting of multiple files
    - ability to receive a scenario completely via SCP
    - path end action info for players on continued paths improved
    - update for intersection behavior
    - extended vehicle indicator light state by lever state
    - considers driver behavior "use of indicator"
    - deleting triggers via SCP
    - deleting players via SCP

VIG Build 2072 (VTD 1.2.3)
    - Added a new post processing step type that renders into cube maps. The step is implemented in PPSCubeMap class. The existing
      functionality is moved to PPSTextureRect class, i.e. plug-in developers need to replace PostProcessingStep class with PPSTextureRect
      in their code. PostProcessingStep is a base class for both of the above.

    - Optimizations in lighting system. Some of the lighting process moved to the Cull thread to reduce to load of the Draw thread.

    - A headlight rendering method based on VIG's lighting system is implemented. This system is not fully tested and in prototype state right now.
      The older headlight system is still available and will be supported until the new system is complete. The selection of headlight
      implementation can be done in the XML configuration files in <HeadlightFactory> sections (in VTD standard headlight configuration
      can be found in the Data/Distros/Distro/Config/ImageGenerator/LightSrcStd.xml). A headlight definition with name HeadlightProjectedTexture
      is used to create a headlight template for the older implementation. HeadlightVIGLighting name can be used for the newer implementation.

    - There is a light source database similar to material database. This can be found in BaseLights.xml.

    - It is possible to use the VIG lights in non-HDR profiles now. However, this feature is in prototype state at this time.

    - Support for Suse 12.1 added. This platform can be used for VIG plug-in development now. Note that OptiX plug-in development
      can only be made on this platform because OptiX library does not support any other platforms in its current version.

    - Added a parallax mapping shader which is used for OpenCRG visualization.

    - OptiX plugin development library uses OptiX 3.0.0 and Cuda 5 now. This upgrade resulted in a problem in loading relatively large
      databases due to a timeout in OptiX library. The OptiX functions that are supposed to be used for timeout management do not
      work as expected.

    - VTD specific
      - OpenSceneGraph header files are included in 3rdParty directory of the VIG SDK. Installation of OpenSceneGraph is not necessary
        anymore for plug-in development.

    - RDBInterface
      - New sub XML configuration element 'ShmLayoutImage' provids extern parameter for shm segment key identifier free- & relase flags
        (attribute 'ShmLayoutImageKey' moved to attribute 'key')
      - IG render control(pause, single frame, continuous) can be triggered via shm.

User objects:
    In order to add own graphical models as objects to VTD you have to edit objectCfg.xml
    accordingly. It already contains some examples.
    ! In VTD 1.1.3 only you additionally have to add an attribute 'templateId' to the
    ! 'ObjectTemplate' tag, that should contain a number referencing a model of the vehicle
    ! database. This workaround will be removed with the 1.2 release, therefore please make
    ! sure to also prepare the 'Model' entries of the object database for this future release.

      then from the respective setup's configuration file; this make general changes
      in the settings much easier and applicable to all setups at once
    - moved materials and sky for standard projects to Distros/Current/Config/ImageGenerator
      (AutoCfg.xml) has been adapted correspondingly


VTD 1.1, RC 1, 18.05.2011
=========================

taskControl 3.4.1:
    - Live Video Recording may be triggered via SCP (32bit IG only in RC1)
        Example:
            <Video>
                <Output path="/tmp" name="vtdTestVideo.mpg"/>
                <Start/>
            </Video>
            
            <Video>
                <Stop/>
            </Video>
        
        Feature <VideoEncoder> must be defined in IGbase.xml, section <FramebufferReader>
        Video format is limited to MPEG-4.
     
    - Introduced command to query position of camera in IG
        Example:
            <Query entity="imageGenerator"><Camera/></Query>"
            
            Reply:
            <Reply entity="imageGenerator"> 
                <Camera> 
                    <PosInertial x="1" y="2" z="3"/> 
                    <ViewInertial h="4" p="5" r="6"/> <!-- angles in [rad] -->
                </Camera> 
            </Reply>
    - after Init procedure is finished, TC will send 
        <SimCtrl> <Run/> </SimCtrl>
    - Replay of SCP commands may be toggled in configuration file (default mode is to replay SCP commands)
        Example:
            <TaskControl> <RecPlay playSCP="true"/> </TaskControl>
    - Debug option "networkLowLevel" introduced
    - RDB 0x0100 introduced
    - name/location of temporary video file can be defined via environment variable VTD_TMP_VIDEO_FILE;
      the conversion and reset scripts have been adapted accordingly
    - initial waypoint paths are transmitted via SCP 
    - visibility of players is now recorded in record file
    - light sources may be defined in more detail via SCP using <Frustum...>, <Intensity...> and <Attenuation...>
    - sensor cone display mode may be switched from outline grid to "filled", showing a textured
      triangle in the principal plane of the sensor (make sure, texture is available)
      Example:
        <Display><SensorSymbols sensor="mySensor" coneStyle="filled" coneOverlayId="3" coneOverlayState="2"/></Display>
    - trigger source for frame sync may be set to RDB in TaskControl configuration file
      Example:
        <TaskControl><Sync source="RDB" /></TaskControl>
    - Components may register for synchronous reading of the shared memory before the next frame can
      be written by a producer. 
      Example:
          Query for the mask by component "myProcess123":
            <Query entity="SHM"> <Sync source="myProcess123" /> </Query>
          Reply with mask number:
            <Reply entity="SHM"> <Sync source="myProcess123" mask="128"/> </Reply>
      The corresponding bit has to be reset by the process "myProcess123" after 
      processing the SHM buffer.
      
    - Mockup "VILSI" does no longer force auto-configuration and auto-restart; these
      parameters have to be set in the <ImageGenerator> tag
      
    - simulation may be triggered (manually) via SCP
        Settings in taskControl.xml:
            <TaskControl><Sync source="SCP"/></TaskControl>
        Synchronization message (for a 40ms frame):
            <SimCtrl><Sync dt="0.040"/></SimCtrl>
            
    - frame-synchronous mode may depend on multiple entities attached via RDB; 
       entities have to register in advance and need to send an RDB sync package
       upon completion of their frame
       Example:
        query by component "veDYNA123"
            <Query entity="RDB"> <Sync source="veDYNA123" /> </Query>
        reply from TC
            <Reply entity="RDB"> <Sync source="veDYNA123" mode="free" /> </Reply>
            <Reply entity="RDB"> <Sync source="veDYNA123" mask="128" mode="frame" /> </Reply>
            
        The mask must be sent by the component using the RDB package
            RDB_PKG_ID_SYNC
            
    - components may register for initialization (i.e. simulation has to wait
      until the respective component has sent InitDone); 
       Example:
        query from component
            <Query entity="taskControl"> <Init source="veDYNA123" /> </Query>
        reply from TC
            <Reply entity="taskControl"> <Init source="veDYNA123" /> </Reply>
            
        After initialization, the component must send its own <InitDone>
            <SimCtrl> <InitDone source="veDYNA123"/> </SimCtrl>
        
     - any component may now register for display of its status in the GUI
        <Info><TaskState name="myComponent" state="run" version="12.0"/></Info>
